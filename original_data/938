Introduction: Taken consistently, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), has demonstrated success in inhibiting HIV viral load replication and reducing morbidity and mortality for people living with HIV. However, adherence to HAART is often suboptimal, compromising the effectiveness of treatment. The Seattle Treatment Education Program (STEP) aims to mitigate treatment adherence barriers by providing education and support through empirically driven, strengths-based, behavior change interventions.</p><p id="__p55">B. Description: The STEP program is based upon a harm-reductionist framework, within a larger agency which ascribes to congruent ideology. Interventions are strengths-based and grounded in Rogerian, Motivational Interviewing, and Solution Focused clinical orientations. Clients meet with a Treatment Education Coordinator (TEC) to assess their specific treatment-related questions, concerns, and barriers. The TEC and client strategize to create concrete steps to maintain adherence. Evidence-based tools, including symptom and barrier assessors, incentives, and regular follow ups, are utilized. Monitoring and evaluating outcomes is completed regularly through use of a specialized database, and qualitative surveys distributed to clients and referring parties.</p><p id="__p56">C. Lessons Learned: Eighty percent of STEP participants maintained or achieved the 95% HAART adherence rate suggested for optimal treatment outcomes. The literature suggests that the grounding theories in which STEP is based are efficacious in brief treatment settings, and our outcomes data supports this assertion. Limitations of the intervention include participant attrition and insufficient access to comprehensive mental health and substance use management resources.</p><p id="__p57">D. Further Recommendations: For many, maintaining treatment adherence is challenging. Implementing programs that offer unlimited sessions of mental health counseling and substance use treatment or harm-reduction strategies for people living with HIV could greatly increase treatment adherence. Additionally, public health policy could be modified with the aim of de-stigmatizing those living with HIV/AIDS. Effective legislation could include acts recognizing and legitimizing same sex couples. Comprehensive, accessible health care should be provided to anyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. These changes could help mitigate the shame reported by some people living with HIV/AIDS, potentially leading to greater help seeking behaviors and lower transmission rates. Additionally, embracing HIV testing as a routine component of primary care could help to reduce HIV incidence and minimize stigma, potentially leading to a number of positive personal and public health outcomes, including increased treatment adherence.</p><p id="__p58">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Katie Querna, MSW, Lifelong AIDS Alliance, Seattle, WA, 98122; katieq@llaa.org</p><p id="__p59">PSW-102</p><p id="__p60">THE RELATIONSHIP OF ANXIETY TO MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF TREATMENT ADHERENCE IN PATIENTS WITH ESRD</p><p id="__p61">Janell Schartel, PhD<sup>1</sup> and DeAnna L.

It has been suggested that the relationship between anxiety and adherence may be indirect and influenced by other cognitive or psychosocial variables such as locus of control or knowledge of disease (Brownbridge &#x00026; Fielding, 1994, DiMatteo et al., 2000). Anxiety has been related to adherence with antibiotic regimens (Cockburn et al., 1987), and for patients with asthma (Baiardini et al., 2006) and COPD (Dowson et al., 2004). A limitation of previous research on anxiety and adherence in ESRD is the failure to investigate the differential impact of anxiety on specific components of adherence (e.g., medication, appointment attendance, dietary guidelines).</p><p id="__p64">The goal of the present study was to conduct a preliminary investigation into the relationship of anxiety and renal disease knowledge to treatment adherence. Data includes 124 veterans with ESRD referred for pre-surgical psychological evaluations for renal transplantation. Renal disease knowledge was assessed in several subcategories of diet, medication, and laboratory tests. Adherence was assessed with respect to diet, medication, and appointment attendance. Both knowledge and adherence were rated by clinicians based on patient self-report and renal team staff-report. Patients were divided into &#x0201c;anxious&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-anxious&#x0201d; groups based on self-reported presence of anxiety symptoms. Data analysis on self-reported compliance revealed that there were no group differences with regard to renal disease knowledge; however, patients in the anxious group were rated as significantly more compliant with renal diet and appointment attendance than non-anxious patients (<em>t</em>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2.20, <em>p</em>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). In addition, regression analyses indicated that anxiety and knowledge significantly predicted compliance with appointment attendance [<em>F</em>(1,116) = 3.68, <em>p</em>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05] and dietary adherence [<em>F</em>(4,115) = 5.95, <em>p</em>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001]. Knowledge, but not anxiety, predicted medication adherence [<em>F</em>(3,114) = 3.63, <em>p</em>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.015]. Results for staff-reported compliance emphasized the role of disease knowledge over anxiety in predicting adherence.</p><p id="__p65">The present data support the need to consider medical adherence as a multifaceted concept by demonstrating that anxiety is related to some aspects of renal disease management. Results also highlight the need for more sophisticated models to explain the influence of anxiety on adherence in patients with ESRD. Limitations of the present study, implications, and suggestions for future research are presented.</p><p id="__p66">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Janell Schartel, PhD, Boston VAMC, Boston, MA, 02130; janell.schartel@va.gov</p><p id="__p67">PSW-103</p><p id="__p68">FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFAULTING FROM COMPLETION OF CHILD FEVER TREATMENT AND REFERRAL IN URBAN ZAMBIAN COMMUNITY. A QUALITATIVE STUDY</p><p id="__p69">Frederick A. Kaona, PhD</p><p id="__p70">Directorate, Mwengu Social and Health Research Centre, Ndola, Zambia.</p><p id="__p71">Background: Recent studies of health care referrals among the under five children with high fever have indicated that incomplete treatment due unfulfilled referrals was the major reason for the children dying in the homes. Despite the Zambian government acknowledging malaria and fever as leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the under five children, the community behaviour and practices on care-giving at household level, have not been well documented. Identification of reasons that lead to an increased number of children dying in the homes is understudied. To try and understand risks and benefits of home management of fever a community qualitative study was conducted.</p><p id="__p72">Methods: Participants consisted of 10 caregivers whose children were 5&#x000a0;years and below old and had died in the community, 10 parents of children 5&#x000a0;years and below, who were admitted in the children&#x02019;s hospital with severe fever, survived and discharged from the hospital and went back home and 10 participants, whose children had fever and survived within the community 14&#x000a0;days prior to the commencement of the study. Questions were devoted to knowledge and attitudes about health seeking behaviour at household level. Knowledge about disease transmission, treatment and prevention, perceived risks of failure to take the child to health facility for early treatment and completion of referrals, were investigated.</p><p id="__p73">Results: Of the 30 key informants who participated in the study, 10 informants were of caregivers of children died before seeing the medical specialist. Majority of children (67.8%) were between 1 and 24&#x000a0;months old. Over 87 and 90 percent respectively were living with biological parents at the time of death. Caretakers from the three groups feared of losing their children if admitted in the children hospital (54.3% and 58.9%). Fear that their children would be exposed to other disease, lack of knowledge about the disease and referral, and lack of medicines in health facilities characterized demotivation for early access of quality care. Fees and transportation resulted in delay accessing health care outside the home and unfulfilled referrals.</p><p id="__p74">Conclusion: Caretakers of under five children should be educated about the benefits of referral compliance and timely treatment of fever. Behavior change interventions are strongly recommended.</p><p id="__p75">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Frederick A.

Only 50% of hypertensive patients adhere to prescribed medication (World Health Organization, 2004). Depression has been considered one of the main psychosocial predictors of medication non-adherence (DiMatteo, Lepper &#x00026; Croghan, 2000). The psychological mechanisms that can explain this relationship remain uncertain.</p><p id="__p81">Objective: To evaluate the role of depression as a medication non-adherence factor in hypertensive patients and the possible psychological mechanism involved in this effect.</p><p id="__p82">Methods: 204 hypertensive patients (67.6&#x000a0;yrs old, 36.8% men) attending Primary Health Care Centers were evaluated in their regular visit to the cardiovascular program. All patients had over 1&#x000a0;year of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and had blood pressure over 140/90&#x000a0;mmHg in the last health control visit. Study variables included depression (POMS-depression scale), medication beliefs (Specific Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire), and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medication (Hill - Bone Medication Adherence Scale).</p><p id="__p83">Results: Depressive patients had a higher level of specific medication concerns than non-depressive patients (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,351, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;,001). Multivariate linear regression shows that medication non-adherence is predicted by depression (B&#x02009;=&#x02009;.172, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), and medication beliefs have a mediating role on this effect. Mediation effects were studied using Baron and Kenny&#x02019;s Criteria (1986): depression predicted medication beliefs (B&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.304, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01); medication beliefs predicted non-adherence (B&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.442, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), and the predictive role of depression on non-adherence decreased when medication adherence was included in the regression equation (B&#x02009;=&#x02009;.012, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.863).</p><p id="__p84">Conclusion: Our results confirm, in a sample of Chilean hypertensive patients, the effect of depression and beliefs about medicine over medication adherence and suggest that concerns about medication should be included in anti-depression psychotherapy for hypertensive patients.</p><p id="__p85">Acknowledgements.

KIIs included HIV peers, treatment providers, NGO stakeholders and researchers. FGDs included experienced ART users, those new to ART and HIV treatment providers; interviews and groups used semi-structured stem questions. Transcriptions were coded based on conceptual relevance; codes were expanded for common themes and grouped into categories.</p><p id="__p93">Results: Provider interviews and groups reflected disparate perceptions regarding the relative importance of specific issues with respect to ART adherence, e.g., patient knowledge, karma, use of alternative medications. Providers agreed, in order of importance, that education, illiteracy, depression and alcohol and drug use negatively affect ART adherence; disagreed on the influence of income, gender and karma. Patients and providers agreed on the impact of HIV knowledge and alternative therapies (homeopathy, ayurveda, unani, yoga, reiki, astrology). Patients expressed concern about food insecurity, stigma, side effects, clinic wait time, distance from clinics and the frequency of visits required. Though medications are no-cost, patients noted the hidden costs of blood tests, travel to clinics, and days missed from work at clinics. For longer term patients, discontinuing medication following remission of symptoms occurred. Enabling migrant and traveling workers to obtain ART during time away from home, social support, increased patient morale, positive attitudes about medication and patient provider communication were identified as key elements in enhancing adherence. Conclusions: Preliminary findings highlight the need for a patient - provider collaborative approach to ART provision and enhancing adherence. Future initiatives to encourage providers and stakeholders to collectively explore existing policies for ART provision will be proposed. This study is supported by NIH grant no.

In the initial period after transplant older patients have higher rates of mortality and morbidity, but in the long-term some studies have suggested that older patients have better adjustment and quality of life compared to younger patients. The purpose of this study was: 1) to identify age differences in long-term adjustment to HT across a range of psychosocial adjustment measures, and 2) to examine other demographic and psychosocial predictors of overall adherence behavior. HT patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;555, mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;54) from multiple centers were assessed 5-10&#x000a0;years post-surgery for adherence behaviors, psychological factors and physical symptoms. Analysis of variance results showed that older adults (age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60) had better adjustment on measures of quality of life, satisfaction with social support, negative affect and disease-related stress compared to younger adults. Linear multiple regression demonstrated that age and several psychosocial factors, including depressive cognitions, accounted for 25.7% of the variance in self-reported difficulty with adherence. Similar variables were significant in a logistic regression analysis predicting which patients would have difficulty or no difficulty with adherence. Clinical implications are discussed in terms of tailoring interventions to age groups for optimal post-operative adjustment.</p><p id="__p100">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Andrea M.

However, little is known about the reasons transplant patients are non-adherent. We previously reported the relationship between increased depressive affect and decreased medication adherence in both transplant and hemodialysis samples. We now report the specific barriers to medication adherence in ninety-four kidney transplant recipients from a major medical center in Brooklyn, New York. Overall, this primarily Black sample endorsed substantive impediment due to (1) too many dosages per day, (2) too many pills per dose, (3) not being able to tell if the medication is helping, and (4) running out of medication. The number of barriers that the sample endorsed was associated with increased depression (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.209, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.049) and decreased medication self-efficacy (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.300, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.004). Surprisingly, there was no relationship between the degree of reported barriers and self-reported medication adherence (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.117 p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.05). To determine which barriers are the most significant to medication adherence, the sample was divided between those individuals who report adequate adherence on a self-report measure (Immunosuppressive Therapy Adherence Scale) and those who report less than adequate adherence. The group with poor adherence reported the following barriers to be significantly more salient: too many doses per day (t (85) = -2.5, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.016); too many pills per dose (t (85) = -2.49, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.015); having to remember to take their medication (t (85)&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;2.2, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03); perceived side effects of the medication (t (85) = -2.9, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.005); skipping a dose to feel good (t (85) = -2.6, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.011); falling out of their daily routine (t (85) = -4.5, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001); and being short of money (t (85) = -3.7, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). This study sheds light on the barriers to immunosuppressant medication adherence in a high-risk population, which may help identify the individuals most at risk of infection, rejection episodes, and ultimately graft failure.</p><p id="__p106">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Melissa Constantiner, BA, Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University, New York, NY, 10011; mconstantiner@gmail.com</p><p id="__p107">PSW-104e</p><p id="__p108">BREAST CANCER, ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS AND NON-ADHERENCE TO AROMATASE INHIBITORS</p><p id="__p109">Arden Corter, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Michael P.

Whether individuals with dementia can evaluate their own Quality of Life (QOL) has been debated. The debate evolves on whether patient ratings or proxy ratings be used or both? The purpose of this study was to determine concordance between the patient&#x02019;s self-report on QOL and caregiver&#x02019;s appraisal on QOL of individual with dementia.</p><p id="__p142">Method: Sixty family caregivers who were living with and caring for person diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and their care recipients participated in the study.

Overall scores were computed separately for the patient and caregiver reports by summing the 13 items, for a total possible score ranging from 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating higher QOL. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and a single- measure intraclass correlation.

And duration from 60&#x000a0;years and its square term and, dummy variables of occupational status and marital status, the number of family cohabiters, the number of friends, and natural logarithm of household income were used as the independent variables.</p><p id="__p153">At first, the results of the Hausman test, which verifies which model is better among fixed and random effect models, adopted fixed effect models for both gender. This fact reveals differences among individual was very small and there are not need to make residual term random.</p><p id="__p154">As the results of fixed effect models, some differences could be seen between genders as follow; 1) For males, a linear term of age was the only significant variable. 2) For women, a square term of age was significant and this means that women worsen their health at an accelerating pace. And marital status and household income was also significant.</p><p id="__p155">It may be difficult to explain the results from the situations in Japan and characteristics in later in life especially for males, because they are getting worse mentally because of ageing. On the other hand, life events in later life like loss of spouse and descent of income was the cause of mental illness for females. This seems to reflect the dependence of wives on husbands.</p><p id="__p156">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Tomoo Nakata, MA, Hokusei Gakuen University, Sapporo, 0048631; tnakata@hokusei.ac.jp</p><p id="__p157">PSW-109</p><p id="__p158">STRUCTURE OF LIFESTYLE-RELATED VARIABLES AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS -A MODEL OF YOUNGER &#x00026; OLDER GROUPS OF ELDERLY JAPANESE-</p><p id="__p159">Ai Nakashima, master caurse,<sup>1</sup> Tomohiko Muratsubaki, Doctor Course,<sup>2</sup> Tadaaki Tomiie, Associate Professor,<sup>3</sup> Toyohiro Hamaguchi, Associate Professor<sup>4</sup> and Yuji Sakano, Professor<sup>3</sup>\n</p><p id="__p160"><sup>1</sup>Graduate school Psychological science, Health Science University of Hokkaido, Sapporo, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Tohoku University of Medicine, Sendai, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, Sapporo, Japan and <sup>4</sup>Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan.</p><p id="__p161">Purposes: (1) To examine the relations among lifestyle, lifestyle disease, waist circumference, life satisfaction, social support, perceived physical ability, and social motivation in younger &#x00026; older groups of elderly Japanese and (2) To validate and compare two models using younger &#x00026; older groups of elderly Japanese.

We selected the control group consisting of seven women (88.0+/-2.6) in the same facility. The life reviews were conducted for ten times in February 2008. Each session lasted for fifteen to thirty minutes. The contents of the interview were about the events and memories in her childhood, adolescence and adulthood until today. We carried out the surveys to evaluate their physical and mental functions using the questionnaires such as Mini Mental State Examination, modified Barthel Index, and Dementia Behavior Disturbance scale. The surveys were done for three times, on the beginning of December 2007, the end of January 2008, and the beginning of March 2008. From the comparisons of the average scores of the questionnaires before and after the life review, MMSE score significantly increased in the life-reviewed group (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

The purpose of this study was to develop CBT for older adults with depression which fit in with Japanese culture and research its effectiveness in outpatient care. By randomized clinical trial recruiting, 15 older adults were chosen. All the participants had a diagnosis of Major depression. The participants were randomly allocated to receive either Treatment as usual (TAU) group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) or CBT group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5). We assessed the degree of depression before the treatments (baseline), at the 6th week and at the 12th week. Measures used in this study were the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Geriatric Depression Scale Japanese version (GDS), and the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale for Depression - Japanese (MADRS-J).In CBT intervention, the psychoeducation about the typical cognitive characteristics of older adults&#x02019; depression and the reminiscence based hearing of subjects&#x02019; compliant were conducted in addition to basic CBT strategy.</p><p id="__p181">The results suggested that the score of SDS was significantly decreased in both CBT group and TAU group at 12th week (CBT; SDS baseline M&#x02009;=&#x02009;54.4, 12th week M&#x02009;=&#x02009;40.6, TAU; SDS baseline M&#x02009;=&#x02009;58.5, 12th week M&#x02009;=&#x02009;46.7). The CBT developed in the present study was effective for improving depressive symptoms. However, the difference between CBT group and TAU group in the score of depression was nonsignificant.

Overall, however, their physical functions were significantly affected by aging, and had decreased to a greater degree in old-old than young-old adults. Especially, it was suggested that balance while standing and the walking ability as well as cognitive functions were more significantly affected by aging than by gender. On the other hand, psychological aspects such as their subjective view of their own health and satisfaction with life showed no significant differences by gender or between age groups, suggesting their lower susceptibility to gender and aging.

In the first phase we interviewed counselors (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) about the content and features this program should include, compiled those responses, then asked counselors to sort and rate the responses using an online concept mapping program. The eight-cluster map provided the most meaningful break out of content: Health Education (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.73), Setting Boundaries in Peer Relationships (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.38), How to Follow Through with Decisions (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.23), Figuring Out What You Really Want (M = 4.18), How to Achieve and Maintain Healthy Relationships (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.06), Working with a Counselor or Sponsor (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.01), Developing Peer Support for Recovery (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.97) and Educational Activities (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.68) [i.e., how to present content from the other clusters]. These findings were used to develop the interactive demonstration version of the proposed program. In the second phase of this project, we presented the demonstration program to these counselors and adolescents for feedback and discussion. Twenty-four adolescents (M=15.8&#x000a0;years) in substance abuse treatment participated in the study. We exceeded our pre-established acceptability criteria (80% of participants will rate their satisfaction with the demo program as &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; (5), &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d; (6), or &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; (7) on the Likert scale questions) with both adolescents (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;84%) and counselors (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;86%).

Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.</p><p id="__p245">According to the World Youth Tobacco Survey, Chile has one of the highest rates of tobacco use among youth around the world. Also, data from Chile suggest that rates of tobacco use between females and males are similar. Researchers have long discussed the role of negative affect on cigarette use among youth. They have proposed that adolescents may use cigarettes to self-medicate and improve their mood. Most of these studies, however, have not explored perceived beliefs associated with cigarette use that may also play a role in explaining the relationship between depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking. In the present study we explored the influence of depressive symptoms and perceived benefits of smoking cigarettes on mood in a sample of 737 chilean youth (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;16,05, range 12 to 25, 54,5% females). Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire from a study that has been examining determinants of cigarette use among adolescents. We explored the relationship using a stepwise regression analyses and entered first demographics, then depressive symptoms variables and finally perceived beliefs about benefits associated with cigarette use. We also included in the model other determinants that have been previously associated with cigarette use as parental smoking and peer influences as control. Our findings suggest that negative affect (Beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;.116, t(566) = 2.607, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.009) does predict current cigarette smoking. Once we entered perceived benefits, depressive symptoms continues to predict cigarette use (Beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;.108, t(566) = 2.456, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.014). Perceived benefits on mood of cigarette smoking (Beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;.115, t(556) = 2.543, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.014) also appear to predict this behavior. Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms influences cigarette use directly and indirectly through the perceived benefits youth perceive have that smoking cigarettes may improve their mood. We also report sex differences and implications of these findings to further understand cigarette use among adolescents.</p><p id="__p246">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Paula Repetto, PhD, P.

Half of the regular smokers die prematurely of a tobacco-related disease. Although the prevalence of youth smoking in some Western countries has been in steady decline, smoking prevalence in many developing countries is increasing. Thailand and Malaysia are in Southeast Asia, one of the critical regions for tobacco consumption.</p><p id="__p252">Objective: To compare the smoking behavior among adolescents in Thailand and Malaysia.</p><p id="__p253">Design/Methods: A population-based, national surveys were conducted among 1,694 adolescents with ages between 13 and 18 from Thailand (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;917) and Malaysia (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;777). Respondents were selected using multistage cluster sampling. Respondents were asked to complete self-administered questionnaires.

On average, Thai smoker reported to have first smoked a whole cigarette at 14.6&#x000a0;years of age (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.93), while Malaysian smoker at age 13.9 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.16). About half of Thai smoker (56.9%) reported that they bought cigarettes for themselves and 31.5 percents got cigarettes from friends. In Malaysia, most of smoker (71.4%) reported that they bought cigarettes for themselves, only 19.8 percents got cigarettes from friends.

A survey instrument was used to collect data in selected point-of-sales in Penang, Malaysia. All new product and pack designs of the most popular cigarette brands were purchased and scrutinized for promotional features. Observations of point-of-sales displays were also made. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods.</p><p id="__p263">Results: Since the banning of advertising at point-of-sales the tobacco industry invested more resources into packaging design and point-of-sale display in order to communicate brand imagery and increase sales primarily targeting children and young people. With the implementation of pictorial health warnings and ban on descriptors, the industry continues to promote its products with introduction of a variety of innovative pack and product designs. Textual descriptors such as light and mild are replaced with varied colour tones (silver and blue) to shape consumer perceptions of risk and have the misleading effect as light and mild. Colours and pack designs are also used by the industry to dilute the effects of pictorial health warnings.</p><p id="__p264">Conclusions: Tobacco control policies have to be water-tight to prevent the tobacco industry from exploiting the loopholes in these policies. The Malaysian government should implement plain packaging which would increase the effectiveness of health warnings, reduce misconceptions about smoking risks and prevent the use of bran variants as a promotional tool.

Clinical reports and empirical data have highlighted the importance of environmental cues (e.g., the sight or smell of a cigarette) in triggering cravings that may lead to relapse following a quit attempt. This &#x02018;cue-induced craving&#x02019; has been reliably modeled under laboratory conditions, in which smokers exposed to smoking-related cues report higher levels of cigarette cravings than following exposure to neutral cues. Whether or not these craving responses predict smoking cessation failure is a matter of some debate in the scientific literature. Retrospective studies have provided mixed results, and prospective studies are generally lacking. Initial results from our longitudinal study of smokers making a cold-turkey untreated smoking cessation attempt are reported here. Briefly, participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20, 50% male, 50% female, mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;37.5&#x000a0;yrs, 60% African American, 15% Hispanic, 20% Caucasian, mean cigarettes/day&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.1) were exposed to smoking (unlit cigarette) and neutral (stapler) cues one week prior to their quit date and reported cravings (0-100) before and after each exposure. Exposures were counterbalanced and separated by a 90-second rest. Time until relapse (Mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.6&#x000a0;days) was assessed at 30&#x000a0;days post quit. Findings indicated that higher pre-quit levels of smoking cue-induced cravings predicted quicker time to relapse (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0006). These preliminary results provide initial support for the validity of modeling cue-induced craving in the laboratory and suggest that cravings triggered by exposure to cues may play an important role in cessation failure.</p><p id="__p275">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Joel Erblich, PhD, MPH, Department of Oncological Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029; joel.erblich@mssm.edu</p><p id="__p276">PSW-121</p><p id="__p277">RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SMOKING STATUS AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES OF JUNIOR-HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS</p><p id="__p278">Daisuke Matsui, Student,<sup>1</sup> Isao Watanabe, student,<sup>1</sup> Masako Shigeta, MD,<sup>1</sup> Nagato Kuriyama, MD,<sup>1</sup> Satoko Mitani, MD,<sup>1</sup> Etsuko Ozaki, MD,<sup>1</sup> Kotaro Ozasa, MD<sup>2</sup> and Yoshiyuki Watanabe, MD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p279"><sup>1</sup>Epidemiology for Community Health and Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan and <sup>2</sup>Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hirosima, Japan.</p><p id="__p280">Background: The smoking rate among adolescents has been decreasing in Japan. According to the National Survey, the current smoking rates of 7th grade students decreased from 7.5% (males) and 3.8% (females) in 1996 to 3.2% and 2.4% in 2004. In Kyoto, workshop-style tobacco-free classes based on theory of behavioral science have been conducted since 2002, in cooperation with a medical university, a medical association and the local government.</p><p id="__p281">Objective: During 2009, we conducted tobacco-free workshops for 3562 students at 26 municipal junior-high schools. In order to clarify the smoking status of these students, we investigated the perception of smoking and the relationship between smoking and other life-style habits. Subjects : There were 1644 students at 13 schools who agreed to participate in the survey. The response rate was 98.1%. Males: 820, Females: 721, not specified: 108.</p><p id="__p282">Methods: The questionnaire was anonymous and self-completed. We made sure that teachers would not check the questionnaire responses. Questions about lifestyle including smoking and drinking, were asked mainly in fourfold choice style. After analyzing the smoking status by school and sex, we examined the relationship between lifestyle and smoking.</p><p id="__p283">Results: The current smoking rate was less than 1% at half of the schools, but 3&#x02009;&#x0223c;&#x02009;7% at 3 schools. Overall, 5.5% of the subjects had tried smoking, and 1.9% were current smokers. 52.9% were living with smokers; 46.7% had tried alcohol; 50.5% watched TV more than 3 hours a day and 4.4% shopped at convenience stores every day. Current smoking and previous smoking showed significant association with smoking by cohabiters, drinking experience, study time, attending school club activities and shopping at convenience stores.</p><p id="__p284">Discussion: The smoking prevalence of subjects was low compared with that in the National Survey, possibly because our subjects were not randomly selected and Kyoto has the lowest smoking prevalence among adults. This is the first report in Japan indicating that smoking habits may be related to shopping at convenience stores. The students are mainly buying cigarettes at convenience stores, where cigarettes companies place a large number of advertisements. Tobacco sales at convenience stores should be strictly monitored.</p><p id="__p285">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Daisuke Matsui, Student, Epidemiology for Community Health and Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, 602-0841; d-matsui@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp</p><p id="__p286">PSW-122</p><p id="__p287">AGE AT SMOKING ONSET AND SMOKING LEVEL AMONG ADOLESCENT SMOKERS IN KOREA</p><p id="__p288">Soon-Woo Park, PhD and Jong-Yeon Kim, PhD</p><p id="__p289">Preventive Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.</p><p id="__p290">The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the age at cigarette smoking onset and the smoking level among adolescent current smokers. In 2007, one or two classes of 10th and 11th grade were randomly selected from the high schools sampled by PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling after all the schools in a large city in Korea were stratified by grade, gender, and region. A total of 743 current smokers among a sample of 4,602 students were analyzed with a self-administered questionnaire. The smokers were defined as those who had smoked at least one cigarette during past one month. The age of smoking onset was measured as the grade when the respondents first tried a cigarette even one or two puffs. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression analysis and they were adjusted for potential confounders. Compared with those who tried smoking first after entrance into high school, the OR of being a frequent smoker (i.e. those who smoked on 20&#x000a0;days or more during the past one month) among those who tried during middle school period was 2.40 (CI 1.53&#x02013;3.78), that of those who tried smoking during late elementary school period was 3.70 (CI 1.67&#x02009;&#x0223c;&#x02009;8.17), that of those who tried smoking early elementary school period or earlier was 3.91 (CI: 1.74&#x02009;&#x0223c;&#x02009;8.78). The OR of being a regular smoker (i.e. those who smoked everyday) among those who tried during middle school period was 1.77 (CI: 1.14&#x02013;2.76), that of those who tried smoking during late elementary school period was 2.34 (CI: 1.14&#x02009;&#x0223c;&#x02009;4.78), that of those who tried smoking early elementary school period or earlier was 4.83 (CI: 2.19&#x0223c;10.69). The OR of being a heavy smoker (i.e. those who smoked one-half pack or more per day on the average) among those who tried during middle school period was 3.61 (CI: 1.84&#x02013;7.08), that of those who tried smoking during late elementary school period was 6.67 (CI: 2.87&#x0223c;15.50), that of those who tried smoking early elementary school period or earlier was 5.65 (CI: 2.34&#x0223c;13.62).

The evidence related to adolescent smoking is limited as well as results using UK data. In this analysis, we assessed the influence of maternal employment in three periods of childhood on smoking of young people aged 16-21&#x000a0;years in British Household Panel Survey (BHPS).</p><p id="__p297">Methods: BHPS is annual panel survey that has started in 1991 and completed its 17th wave in 2007. Response rate to wave 1 was 74%, and response between waves 2 and 17 varied between 84%&#x02013;89%. There are 3,615 young individuals with available data on smoking at age 16&#x02013;21 and maternal employment data from age 0&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years. Covariates, such as gender, maternal age, maternal education and marital status, household income or maternal smoking were used as explanatory variables in logistic regression analysis in STATA 10.</p><p id="__p298">Results: 29% of young adults aged 16&#x02013;21 reported being current smoker. Approximately 40% of mothers worked at some point during age 0&#x02013;4 (preschool age) of their child. This proportion increased to 59% at age 5&#x02013;11 (primary school age) and 68% at age 12&#x02013;16 (secondary school age). Children of mothers who were not employed were more likely to smoke (OR of smoking 1.18, 1.19 and 1.60 for 3 periods of exposure), although these effects were almost entirely explained when adjusted for maternal education and household income.</p><p id="__p299">Conclusions: The associations between maternal employment in childhood and young adults&#x02019; smoking exist at least partly because of the generally higher social position and more stable family structure of households with working mothers.

In this study we describe health provider&#x02019;s motivational interviewing (MI) consistent and inconsistent responses during the first interview and we study the effects of these responses on adherence to treatment.</p><p id="__p326">Method: Participants were 142 adolescents with substance use disorders seeking admission to the program during 2009 (64% men; 15. yrs old, 11 to 19; 79.6% with substance abuse for 6&#x000a0;month or more) and their mental health providers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18), from 10 health centers. All of them volunteered to participate according to the informed assents and consents. We audio-taped the initial interviews and analyzed their content using the MISC 2.1 coding system.

Former (.47; .37&#x02013;.61) and occasional (.62; .44&#x02013;.88) smokers were less likely to see the smoking restrictions being supervised enough. Former smokers were 2.31 (1.63&#x02013;3.27) times more likely to see tobacco use as approved behavior in society compared to daily smokers. Nine out of ten subjects agreed that youth smoking needs to be restricted, yet quitters agreed more likely (1.67; 1.18&#x02013;2.37) than daily smokers. 61 % of former, 52 % of occasional and 34 % of daily smokers agreed that tobacco sales points should be reduced [F: 2.98 (2.38&#x02013;3.72), O: 2.33 (1.70&#x02013;3.20)]. Former (6.24; 4.69&#x02013;8.32) and occasional (4.85; 3.34&#x02013;7.04) smokers were more likely to agree with smoking ban in balcony. Former and occasional smokers were less likely to agree that society should support quitters with tobacco-related disease (F: .57; .46&#x02013;.70, O: .56; .41&#x02013;.76) or all who quit smoking (F: .63; .51&#x02013;.79, O: .51; .38&#x02013;.70).</p><p id="__p347">Conclusions: Most former and current smokers hold positive opinions towards tobacco control.

Based on clinical cut-offs,82% reported stress within moderate to severe levels. Due to care costs,74% patients depleted savings,44% downsized living accommodations; 32% caregivers worked extra jobs to help pay for care,60% reported extra stress at work. To reduce costs,49% patients delayed seeking psychological counseling. Among patients, increased intrusion correlated with having no one to help with insurance questions (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001). Increased avoidance was associated with delay in seeking psychological counseling (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001) and less awareness of co-pay assistance (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001). 33% patients and 40% caregivers felt too overwhelmed to apply for financial help.</p><p id="__p357">Discussion: These data suggest that managing cancer costs is associated with clinically significant stress levels.

The SIPP is a short, validated questionnaire to identify distress in cancer patients. Our aim is to test the hypotheses that using the SIPP in physician-patient consultations may prevent underdiagnosis of early distress symptoms resulting in better psychological functioning and quality of life(QoL) in both the short- and long-term. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted. Cancer patients were asked to complete questionnaires measuring sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosocial distress and QoL at baseline before starting radiotherapy (RT) (T1) and post-tests at 3 (T2) and 12&#x000a0;months (T3) after baseline. Results: 569 Cancer patients were included. Preliminary results show at T2 that women of the control groups reported more cognitive dysfunction (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015) than women of the intervention groups. Patients of the control groups with rectum cancer reported more symptoms of depression (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.039), and psychosocial distress in general (p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.030) than the same patients of the interventions groups. The percentage of patients with prostate (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045) and rectum cancer (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.044) with anxiety were higher in the control groups. At T3, patients of the control groups with breast cancer reported more symptoms of anxiety (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.012) and psychosocial distress (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.048). The percentage of lung cancer patients with psychosocial distress was higher in the control groups (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.030).</p><p id="__p365">Conclusion: Cancer patients receiving a minimal psychosocial intervention seem to improve in psychosocial functioning at T2 and T3 and marginally improve QoL at T2.

Portenoy created the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) around 1990 to assess symptom frequency, severity, and distress; it has been used extensively with cancer patients. The MSAS scores include the Global Distress Index (GDI), based on the distress scores associated with 6 physical symptoms and the frequency scores of 4 psychological symptoms.</p><p id="__p372">Methods: We sent survey packets (the MSAS and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACT - G), a quality of life measure) to patients diagnosed with the 5 most common cancer diagnoses in our cancer center (breast, colorectal, gynecologic, lung, and prostate cancers). A total of 458 patients returned surveys. We revised the method for calculating the GDI by using the symptom reports of our sample, using the 6 most common physical symptoms (lack of energy, difficulty sleeping, problems with sexual interest/ activity, pain, feeling drowsy, and numbness/ tingling of the hands and feet) and the 4 most common psychological symptoms (worrying, feeling sad, feeling irritable, and feeling nervous). We compared the MSAS Total Score, the GDI, our revised GDI, and the total number of symptoms to determine which best predicts patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p id="__p373">Results: Our sample yielded X&#x02009;=&#x02009;86.3 FACT Total score and these MSAS scores: X&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.7 symptoms; X&#x02009;=&#x02009;.5 Total score, X&#x02009;=&#x02009;.9 GDI score, and X&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2 revised GDI score. These compared to Portenoy&#x02019;s X&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.5 symptoms and X&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3 GDI score. Our revised GDI score was highly correlated with the original GDI (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.90, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01). Of the various measures, the MSAS Total score correlated most highly with overall quality of life (rs&#x02009;=&#x02009;.72, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01).</p><p id="__p374">Discussion: The top physical symptoms reported by our patients differed from the original MSAS results, likely due to changes in cancer treatment over the years. While this might suggest the need to revise the method for calculating the GDI, our revised GDI was virtually identical to the original GDI. Our results indicated that the MSAS Total score is most representative of symptom burden.</p><p id="__p375">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Teresa L.

Patients are seen as active information seekers who require involvement. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore whether patients are consistent in their preference for information and involvement in treatment decisions throughout a cancer journey. Methods: Patients (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;22, Mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;57&#x000a0;years, 9 men and 13 women) with various cancers, who were in the end of their treatment, participated in semi-structured interviews concerning information needs. Prior to the interview patients were given a brief questionnaire and asked their preference for information given by the clinician (prefer all, only positive or minimal information) and for participating in decision making (prefer to participate or prefer the clinician to make decisions concerning my treatment). After completing the questionnaire patients were interviewed focusing on the patients experiences of information. The interviews were analysed according to the principles of thematic analysis. Results: Eighteen out of 22 patients reported that they wanted all available information and to participate in decisions about treatment. However, during the interviews some patients expressed different attitudes towards level of information and involvement. Some patients experienced changes in treatment and chose to let the clinician decide the treatment. There were also divergent statements concerning the amount of desired information, which could be related to the situational aspects of information needs. Furthermore, patients seemed to prefer positive information from clinicians in the early stages of treatment. Conclusions: Even though patients view themselves as individuals who want a high level of information regarding their cancer and want to be involved in treatment decisions, this study reveals some discrepancy between patients beliefs and their behaviours, which can be influenced by various situational factors.</p><p id="__p388">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: B.

According to a Swedish study, cancer patients do not use religious coping as described by Pargament et. al. (1998) but prefer a more spiritual way of coping with illness.</p><p id="__p394">Aim: To provide preliminary content-validation of RCOPE-14 and a new spiritual coping dimension added to the original instrument in a Danish sample.</p><p id="__p395">Method: RCOPE-14 was translated and moderated to fit Danish culture. A spiritual dimension was added, in case respondents could not identity with the concept &#x0201c;God&#x0201d;. The content validity was explored in 3 focus group discussions with 1) a mixed group of non-believers and secular Christians, 2) a group of spiritual believers, and 3) a group of religious believers.</p><p id="__p396">Results: All groups agreed that the spiritual dimension was an essential addition to the instrument. The spiritual dimension was found to address coping in the group of spiritual believers coping very well, and the religious dimension appears to cover coping in the group of religious believers. In contrast, the group of non-believers and secular Christians were unable to identity with the ways of coping suggested by the instrument - especially the religious dimension, which according to this group is seen as only relevant to highly religious individuals. However, the group of non-believers and secular Christians agreed that faith was important to them, but only in a very individual, non-religious way.</p><p id="__p397">Conclusion: Adding a spiritual dimension to RCOPE seems essential if the instrument is to be applied in Danish research on faith and health. In addition, the development of items relevant to individuals, who do not see themselves as religious or spiritual, should be considered prior to the application of quantitative validation procedures in a larger sample</p><p id="__p398">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Heidi F.

However, much less is known about the natural course of these symptoms throughout the cancer treatment trajectory. Also, the contribution of medical factors such as cancer site, stage and treatments in explaining changes in these symptoms has yet to be established. As part of a larger research, this study investigated longitudinal changes of these symptoms in patients scheduled to undergo surgery for cancer (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;828). The patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and a pain questionnaire developed by our research team at six time points: at baseline (T1), as well as 2 (T2), 6 (T3), 10 (T4), 14 (T5) and 18 (T6) months later. Analyses of variance showed significant reductions of depression, anxiety and insomnia levels over time (ps&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001), which were mostly marked between T1 and T3. Fatigue levels were fairly stable, whereas pain increased slowly but significantly over time (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001). Prostate cancer patients had significantly lower levels of anxiety, insomnia, fatigue and pain (ps&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001 or less) compared to patients with other types of cancer, but no significant differences were found across cancer stages over time. Patients having received chemotherapy were those displaying the greatest levels of insomnia and fatigue (ps&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05 or less), whereas patients treated by surgery only (no radiation or hormone therapy, or chemotherapy) were those displaying the lowest levels of anxiety and insomnia (ps&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001 or less) over time. In summary, cancer patients reported an overall decrease in depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms, stable fatigue and an increase in pain over the 18-month period following surgery. Results also revealed some differences across cancer sites and treatment regimens received. Further longitudinal studies are needed in order to identify additional factors associated with changes in cancer-related symptoms over time.</p><p id="__p411">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Claudia Trudel-Fitzgerald, BA, Groupe de recherche en psycho-oncologie, Centre de recherche de l&#x02019;H&#x000f4;tel-Dieu de Qu&#x000e9;bec, Quebec, QC, G1R 2&#x000a0;J6; claudia.trudel-fitzgerald.1@ulaval.ca\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583833837968" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figg_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figg_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figg_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583833837968" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p412">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sidsel Bekke-Hansen, MSc, Psychology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, 8000; sidsel@psy.au.dk</p><p id="__p413">PSW-140</p><p id="__p414">DIET AND VOLUNTARY EXERCISE AFFECT PERIPHERAL MONOCYTE NUMBERS AND ACTIVITY IN MICE</p><p id="__p415">Stephanie Cull, BSc,<sup>1,2</sup> Rene Figueredo, MSc,<sup>2</sup> Amy Kossert, MHK,<sup>1</sup> Harry Prapavessis, PhD<sup>1</sup> and James Koropatnick, PhD<sup>1,2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p416"><sup>1</sup>University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada and <sup>2</sup>Lawson Health Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.</p><p id="__p417">Physical activity (PA) and good dietary habits can moderate obesity while enhancing immune status, decreasing cancer risk.

Number and function of circulating blood monocytes from C57BL/6 mice were measured after 6&#x000a0;weeks of PA on a voluntary running wheel, compared with sedentary controls (SE). PA and SE groups were further subdivided into groups fed a high fat diet (PA-HF and SE-HF) and normal diet (PA-ND and SE-ND). Mice allowed access to a running wheel ran approximately 12&#x000a0;km/day, and displayed expected decreases in body weight and body fat compared to mice without access to running wheels (SE). Cells were collected from peripheral blood (posterior vena cava) and peritoneum (by lavage). Using flow cytometry, cell numbers (CD11b status), and both basal and chemically-induced activation states (CD11b signal/monocyte) were determined. For HF diet mice, regardless of exercise, the number of circulating monocytes was higher than in similarly-treated ND mice; the fraction of monocytes in the total white blood cell population was 6.4% vs. 4.6% (PA-HF and PA-ND, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and 5.9% vs 4.5% (SE-HF and SE-ND, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

Several studies have used the Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) scale to measure adjustment to cancer. Notwithstanding the fact that the MAC scale is considered an adequate tool to measure adjustment responses to cancer, no psychometric analysis has yet been made in Dutch patients. In this study the psychometric properties of the original 5 subscales and the 2 recently proposed summary scales of the MAC scale were examined in Dutch cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.</p><p id="__p426">Methods: Data from 289 cancer patients were assessed with the MAC scale and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression scale (HADS); 259 patients completed the MAC scale for a second time.</p><p id="__p427">Results: In total, 85.5% of the participants completed the full MAC-scale. The internal consistency of the 5 subscales and the summary scales were mostly similar to the original versions. The test-retest reliability of the Fighting Spirit (FS), Helplessness/Hopelessness (HH), Anxious Preoccupation (AP), Summary Positive Adjustment (SPA) and Summary Negative Adjustment (SNA) subscales were moderate and the test-retest reliability of the Fatalism (F) and Avoidance (A) subscales were low. Correlations between the original and the 2 summary scales of the MAC scale and the HADS depression and anxiety subscales indicated good convergent validity. The structure of the 5 subscales as well as the structure of the 2 summary scales was adequate as shown by construct validity using confirmatory factor analyses.</p><p id="__p428">Conclusion: The Dutch version of the MAC scale is a feasible questionnaire and appeared to have comparable psychometric properties as demonstrated by studies in the UK. The psychometric properties of SPA and SNA subscales and FS and HH subscales seem to be acceptable. This supports the cross-national usefulness of the MAC scale.</p><p id="__p429">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anna Braeken, MSc, Health care and nursing science, Maastricht University, Maastricht, 6229 HR; v.braeken@zw.unimaas.nl</p><p id="__p430">PSW-142</p><p id="__p431">PREDICTORS OF LOW-INCOME MOTHERS&#x02019; INTENTION TO VACCINATE THEIR DAUGHTERS AGAINST HPV</p><p id="__p432">Tiffany Floyd, PhD</p><p id="__p433">Psychology, The City College of New York, New York, NY.</p><p id="__p434">The availability of an efficacious vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), the necessary cause of cervical cancer, provides unprecedented opportunity to eliminate income-based disparities in cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. Realization of this potential, however, will depend in part on low-income mothers&#x02019; decisions to either vaccinate or not vaccinate their daughters against HPV. Using a community-based sample of low-income mothers (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;77), the present study sought to elucidate psychosocial factors associated with mothers&#x02019; intentions to vaccinate their age-eligible daughters against HPV. Thirty-five percent of the sample had never heard of HPV. Knowledge about the virus, including its prevalence and relation to cervical cancer, did not relate to mothers&#x02019; intention to vaccinate their daughters within the next 1 to 2&#x000a0;years; however, intention did relate to attitudes and beliefs about the vaccine. Results from chi-square analyses indicated that intention to vaccinate ones daughter was associated with the belief that the vaccine could prevent future problems for their daughter (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), wanting to do what their daughter&#x02019;s pediatrician recommends regarding the HPV vaccine (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01), and that the vaccine could benefit both men and women (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04). Intending to vaccinate ones daughter was also associate with disagreement with the belief that vaccines in general can be dangerous (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05) and lower educational attainment (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05).

Studies applying exercise, relaxation and psychoeducation have each indicated a positive impact on physical performance and/or psychological wellbeing in persons with cancer.

There were similar intergroup longitudinal patterns revealing that scores at three months were determinants for the adjustment level at six months. Furthermore, improved muscle strength was significantly associated with less cognitive avoidance. Interviews reveal a dynamic adjustment process in both the intervention and control groups where active &#x00026; passive adaption strategies and positive &#x00026; negative emotions were used to cross over &#x02018;transition&#x02019; periods.

This study examined two key aspects of communication: self efficacy for symptom communication and holding back from disclosing cancer related concerns. The sample included post-menopausal breast cancer survivors taking adjuvant hormonal therapy (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;35). Participants were on average 60.6&#x000a0;years old (SD 7.4), mostly Caucasian (91%), and over half had at least a college education. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the degree to which self-efficacy for symptom communication and holding back predicted measures of symptoms and adjustment. These analyses controlled for demographic and medical variables that were significantly correlated with outcomes. Results indicated that holding back about discussing cancer related concerns, but not self-efficacy for symptom communication, was a significant predictor of menopausal symptoms, fatigue, intimacy, and functional well-being. Specifically, holding back was a significant predictor of physical menopausal symptoms (t(30) = 4.05, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.000), fatigue (t(31) = 3.47, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002), intimacy (t(30) = &#x02212;2.52, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017), and functional well-being (t(31) = &#x02212;3.77, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001). Patients who reported a greater tendency to hold back from discussing their cancer related concerns had higher levels of menopausal symptoms (such as difficulty sleeping or a decrease in physical strength) and fatigue and lower levels of intimacy and functional well being. Taken together these findings suggest that holding back from disclosing cancer-related concerns is a significant and consistent predictor of symptoms and adjustment to breast cancer in women taking adjuvant hormonal therapy to prevent recurrence. These findings raise the possibility that interventions designed to address symptom communication might be helpful to those patients who are prone to holding back from discussing their cancer-related concerns.</p><p id="__p468">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sara N.

Even less is known about the psychosocial risk factors for depression across the maturational spectrum. Although premenstrual and postmenstrual women diagnosed with BCA share a substantially elevated risk of developing a major depression; the coping resources, life challenges, and cancer impact may differ markedly for younger and older women. The current study examined coping styles, social support quality, stressful life events, sleep quality, and sexual functioning in 103 women, ages 27 to 69, who had completed treatment for BCA within the previous five years.</p><p id="__p474">Women were sampled from across the U.S. and completed study measures electronically. The mean age of the sample was 46.71 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.88; median&#x02009;=&#x02009;46). The sample was generally well-educated with 94.6% of the sample having at least some college education.

Despite this differential level of life threat, current findings indicate that the emotional impact of BCA is generally equivalent across the maturational spectrum. Both younger and older BCA survivors endorsed significant levels of generalized psychological distress, as measured by the BSI, which was characterized primarily by rumination, anxiety, and hostility. Beck Depression Inventory-2 scores indicated that the sample, on average, experienced mild to moderate levels of depressive symptoms with younger women tending to be more symptomatic than the older women, although the difference did not reach significance (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.68, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.09).

Recent literature, however, suggests that it is not simply received support that influences psychosocial adjustment but rather the type of support received (i.e., preferred or non-preferred) that may play the most significant role in the psychosocial outcome for women with breast cancer. The primary aim of this study is to better articulate the role of received support and its impact on psychosocial adjustment. We hypothesized that non-preferred support functions as an additional stressor over and above the stress of life threatening illness and, as such, adversely impacts psychosocial adjustment. Conversely, the receipt of preferred support was hypothesized to be positively associated with indicators of healthy psychosocial adjustment.</p><p id="__p483">Preliminary data suggest that there is, in fact, a positive and significant relationship between the frequency with which non-preferred support is received and levels of stress reported by the recipient (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.044). Additionally, the data suggest that there is a significant negative correlation between the frequency with which preferred support is received and dysfunctional sexual symptoms associated with cancer (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.026). Psychoeducational feedback about current levels of preferred and received support was provided to participants in tandem with their primary caregivers with the goal of increasing the probability of receiving higher frequencies of preferred support and lowering the probability of receiving non-preferred support. These data have not yet been analyzed but will be available well in advance of the conference. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of aligning the social support preferences of the patient with the nature of the support that she receives in order to prevent the burden of additional stress while coping with life threat and to enhance psychosocial adjustment.</p><p id="__p484">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Adele S.

The key challenges of this study lay in measuring and incorporating affect into the assessment of risk perception and screening behavior, and in finding and recruiting women at high risk of ovarian cancer in the general population. The first challenge was met through developing a scale to access the experience of cancer among friends and relatives. Incorporating both emotion and cognition into a model of perceived risk and screening suggested use of the heuristic processing model and Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation of Health and Illness as theoretical frameworks. The second challenge led us to conduct the study in an HMO population which provided a defined population setting from which women at high risk could be recruited. The study was composed of a baseline and one-year follow-up survey. From a list of 55,887 managed care enrollees, we conducted a telephone eligibility screening of 20,483 randomly-selected women (screening rate 36.7%), with the aim of oversampling women at high risk. Of 16,720 women (81.6%) deemed eligible for the study, we selected 3,307 for interview, completing 2,524 interviews (response rate 76.3%). A one-year follow-up among 1,910 women (response rate 77.7%) who were interviewed at baseline provided information on change in perceived risk and screening behavior. The strengths of this study include a theoretically-based design, a large, racially diverse managed care population, and novel questions designed to assess the experience of cancer among friends or relatives.</p><p id="__p490">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lucy A.

However, it is also an opportunity for personal growth(Jim &#x00026; Jacobsen., 2008). Evaluating the long-term effects of cancer and its treatment, we have to investigate the impact of cancer in life domains. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the cancer in Japanese childhood cancer patients after discharge. Subjects were 25 childhood cancer patients attending the pediatric outpatient clinics (8 male and 17 female, mean age at survey&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.6&#x000a0;yrs, mean age at diagnosis&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1&#x000a0;yrs). Approximately 18 patients had leukemia and 4 each suffered from malignant lymphoma and bone tumor, respectively. They were asked to participate in a semi-structured interview regarding the impact of the cancer after discharge from medical treatment. The data was analyzed with the content analysis, chi-square test, and correspondence analysis. A total of 11 attributes were extracted and categorized as follows: changes due to the cancer (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;24) and perceptions of the cancer(N&#x02009;=&#x02009;14). The attributes indicated by many of the participants were &#x0201c;having cancer brought my family closer together(N&#x02009;=&#x02009;14)&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;I have met various people(N&#x02009;=&#x02009;12)&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cancer has been the precious experience of my life(N=11)&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;I wonder why I got cancer(N&#x02009;=&#x02009;9)&#x0201d;. Some attributes of positive changes due to the cancer and perceptions of the cancer were statistically significant differences among age. This study identified the important components of the impact of the cancer in Japanese childhood cancer patients after their discharge. Most patients thought that good things have come out of having had cancer. In addition, older patients have more diversified views of the cancer than younger patients because they have had many problems and benefits.</p><p id="__p496">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Yuko Takei, MA, WASEDA univ., Tokorozawa, 3591192; yuko-t@akane.waseda.jp</p><p id="__p497">PSW-146</p><p id="__p498">TREATMENT OF ASTHMA IN PUERTO RICAN CHILDREN</p><p id="__p499">Elizabeth R.

The purpose of this study was to describe the treatment, healthcare utilization, and morbidity of children with asthma in Puerto Rico. This phase of the study involved the administration of a parent interview, spirometry and physician examination, in order to learn more about medical care of children with asthma. Evaluations were conducted in 2001 on a sample of 300 5-10&#x000a0;year-old children enrolled in public schools in San Juan, including both children whose parents reported they had asthma (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;190) and presumed healthy children (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;110). The mean age was 6&#x000a0;years old (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;.9&#x000a0;years) and 50.2% were females. Among those with asthma, 32% were prescribed anti-inflammatory medications, with 49% receiving only bronchodilators, and 18% not receiving any asthma medications. Using NHANES criteria, 46% had mild and 54% had moderate-severe asthma; of the latter, 13% of parents reported not having any medication prescriptions for their children. Children with asthma and those without did not differ on environmental risk factors or on forced vital capacity (FVC) measures. However, parents of children with asthma, compared to those without, reported they had significantly more symptoms of asthma in the last 14&#x000a0;days (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02) and missed more school in the last two months due to asthma (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02). Mean number of doctor visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations for asthma in the past year were 2.72, 1.64, and 0.42, respectively. Forty-one percent of parents of children with asthma reported that they did not have written instructions for taking medications; 96% were not told to use a peak flow meter; 82% did not have a written care plan for asthma care at school; and 72% did not having a written plan for environmental triggers. Of those prescribed nebulizer treatments, 51% reported not adhering to recommendations. Sixty-seven percent of those who were prescribed medication reported not adhering because of concerns regarding potential side effects. These results indicate that in 2001 children in San Juan were not being optimally treated for asthma. Given the high prevalence and morbidity of asthma in Puerto Rico, there is a need for educational efforts to improve treatment practices.</p><p id="__p502">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Elizabeth R.

Only a few studies looked into social support as a contributor and suggest that patients&#x02019; perceptions of support are indicative for their wellbeing. Research in other chronic diseases shows that overprotection (e.g. unnecessary help) and protective buffering (e.g. concealing worries) as reported by partners is often related to distress in patients. We studied overprotection and protective buffering in relation to distress in COPD patients, from a dyadic perspective.</p><p id="__p508">Methods: 103 couples were approached at a pulmonary rehabilitation center and an outpatient clinic. The analyses were performed using a sample of the 68 couples who consented (to take part in the study). We assessed distress with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25. Patients&#x02019; and partners&#x02019; perceptions of partner support were measured with a questionnaire developed by Buunk et al (1996). Data were analysed using bivariate correlations and a stepwise regression analysis.</p><p id="__p509">Results: Mean age of patients was 63.8 (&#x000b1;9.5) and of partners 62.3 (&#x000b1;9.7). More male patients participated (57.4%) and more patients of the outpatient clinic (55.9%). Patients were quite distressed (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;44.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.4). Distress was predicted by patients&#x02019; perceptions of protective buffering (R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), partners&#x02019; report of overprotection (R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and differences within a couple in their perception of overprotection (R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).</p><p id="__p510">Conclusions: Overprotection and protective buffering by partners explain a great deal of the variance in COPD patients&#x02019; distress.

This hypothesis has not been tested in an immigrant population. The current study assessed the effects of perceived social support and problem-focused and emotion-focused coping on CVR to stress among Chinese immigrants in the New York City area. Method: First generation Chinese immigrants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;150; Mean Age&#x02009;=&#x02009;53&#x000a0;years old; 86 Females, Average Length of Stay in the United States&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x000a0;years) were recruited from the New York Downtown Hospital in Chinatown. Following the study description and informed consent procedures, participants completed questionnaires which assessed social support and their use of problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies. Following an 8-minute adaptation period, participants recalled a stress-provoking event related to their immigration experience in a semi-structured interview format. Recovery was monitored for 20 minutes and participants were debriefed. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored at 2 minute intervals during baseline and recovery, and 1 minute intervals during the interview. Result: Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that the interaction perceived social support and emotion-focused coping is associated with low baseline SBP, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;-.18, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;-2.19, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.03. However, perceived social support and emotion-focused coping is associated with higher SBP during provocation, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.23, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.70, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01. Conclusion: Availability of social support is reassuring when coupled with the use of emotion-focused coping, and when the situation demands low coping resources (as during baseline). However, under conditions of stress where the demand for coping resources is high (e.g., during stress provocation), perceived social support and the use of emotion-focused coping does not help and may actually suggest an increase in CVR to stress. This may be related to the Chinese value of collectivism, which may manifest itself through an unwillingness to burden others with personal needs.</p><p id="__p517">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Christine Lee, MA, Yeshiva University, New York, NY, 10075; ysclee@gmail.com</p><p id="__p518">PSW-149</p><p id="__p519">OBESITY MEDIATES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS</p><p id="__p520">Mollie R.

Depressive symptoms are also associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and cardiovascular risk factors. We examined whether lifestyle factors mediated relations of depressive symptoms to cardiovascular risk factors in 205 healthy, community-dwelling older adults (55% male; mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;66&#x000a0;years). Participants underwent a medical history, physical examination, blood chemistries, exercise treadmill testing with maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2max), an oral glucose tolerance test, clinical assessment of blood pressure and body mass index (BMI), completion of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and assessment of smoking status and number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week. Primary outcome variables included systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose levels at 0 and 120 minutes, waist circumference, triglycerides, and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol. Potential mediators assessed were number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week, smoking status, Vo2max, and BMI. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, education, sex, race, and use of antihypertensives revealed a significant positive association between depression and triglyceride levels (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.2, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.009), waist circumference (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.56, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), and BMI (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.03, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001). Subsequent regression models testing for possible mediation indicated that the relation of BDI to triglycerides was mediated by BMI. Thus, in healthy older adults, depressive symptoms are associated with increased body mass, waist circumference, and triglyceride levels, and body mass mediates the relation of depressive symptoms to triglyceride levels. Obesity may be an important mechanism by which depressive symptoms influence cardiovascular risk in older adults.</p><p id="__p523">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Mollie R.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the psychosocial, cognitive, physical, and demographic profiles of patients with COPD and IPF with the goal of better understanding similarities and differences among patients with these pulmonary disorders. Patients with COPD (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;16; Female&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) and IPF (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;15; Female&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) were recruited from The Ohio State University outpatient pulmonary clinics. Participants completed three visits over the course of twelve months and at each session completed a series of questionnaires and cognitive function tests. At baseline and twelve months, participants completed pulmonary evaluations. IPF patients were significantly older (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;69.3) than COPD patients (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;58.7) and had better pulmonary functioning (FEV1 % predicted&#x02009;=&#x02009;75.7% in IPF vs. 44.2% in COPD). All analyses of psychological functioning and cognitive performance were conducted controlling for age. COPD patients indicated significantly more symptoms of depression (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01; CES-D) and anxiety (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05; BAI) than did IPF patients. COPD patients also reported less social support (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01, PSSS). In addition, COPD patients indicated significantly poorer emotional quality of life, as reflected in the Mental Component Score of the SF-36. However, no differences were observed between COPD patients and IPF patients on the Physical Component Score of the SF-36 or in symptoms of breathlessness, sleep quality, or cognitive performance. Thus, although perceptions of physical quality of life and breathlessness are similar among COPD and IPF patients, patients with COPD indicate significantly greater symptoms of emotional distress and poorer emotional quality of life than patients with IPF. Heightened distress among patients with COPD is important to consider in treatment of patients. In addition, further evaluation of disease-related processes and biological differences between COPD and IPF patients is needed to understand mechanisms that may explain the observed differences.</p><p id="__p529">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Kendea N.

Turner, Psychology (PhD)</p><p id="__p559">Behavioral Psychology, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine/Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD.</p><p id="__p560">According to the NIMH (2004), a significant number of children suffer from untreated emotional and behavioral problems. This lack of service use has significant implications considering that mental health (MH) problems during childhood can lead to difficulties later in life. Despite increased efforts to tailor MH services to the needs of each consumer, ethnocultural disparities in access to and use of these services continue to abound (Yamada &#x00026; Brekke, 2008). Findings suggest that ethnic minority populations have a higher unmet need than Non-Hispanic Whites (e.g., Diala et al, 2002). However, efforts to explain disparities in MH services have been limited. Researchers have identified several variables that influence individuals to utilize mental health services such as income, ethnicity, and attitudes (e.g., Cepeda-Benito &#x00026; Short, 1998; Turner &#x00026; Liew, in press). Obasi &#x00026; Leong (2009) hypothesize that it is also important to note that group difference exists, and it is imperative that future research investigate cultural variables (acculturation, traditions, etc.). Previous research has found some ethnic minority groups use coping sources (i.e., friends, family) and practices (i.e., family, social, and religious) that are more consistent with their cultural beliefs instead of those more consistent with traditional MH services (e.g., Harrison et al., 2004; McMiller &#x00026; Weisz, 1996). The purpose of the current study is to examine to role of cultural identity, religiosity, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and attitudes on utilization of MH service among European Americans and non-European Americans. Participants were 150 caregivers (89% female) recruited from the Southwest United States. Mean age of participants was 34.4&#x000a0;years old. Participants completed the following measures a demographic questionnaire, the Parental Attitudes Toward Psychological Services Inventory (PATPSI; Turner, 2006), and self-reported their cultural identity, religiosity, and likelihood of mental health service use. Results indicated that both attitudes and PBC were positively related to utilization, and participants&#x02019; ratings of cultural identity and religiosity were not correlated with utilization. When examining group differences between European Americans and non-European Americans mean differences were only noted for perceived behavioral control. European Americans reported feeling more control over their ability to seek services if warranted. Finally, both perceived behavioral control and attitudes independently predicted utilization of mental health services. Implications for future research and applications to families will be discussed.</p><p id="__p561">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Erlanger A.

BMI was measured at age 10&#x000a0;years and self-reported at age 34&#x000a0;years. Audiometry was conducted at age 10&#x000a0;years.

A sample of 1,656 adolescents participated in both baseline and follow-up. Of these 1,402 had a body mass index (BMI=weight/height2kg/m2) below 25 at baseline when adjusted for age and gender according to guidelines from International Obesity Taskforce, and were at risk of developing overweight during the study period. The main outcome measures were change in BMI and development of overweight (from BMI&#x0003c;25 to BMI&#x0003e;=25).</p><p id="__p588">Results: Average BMI increased from 21.3 to 22.7 for girls and from 20.6 to 23.6 for boys from age 15 to 21. An inverse social gradient in overweight was seen for girls at baseline and follow-up and for boys at follow-up. In the full population there was a tendency to a social gradient in the overall increase in BMI for girls, but not for boys. A total of 13.4 percent developed overweight during the follow-up period. Girls of lower socioeconomic position had a higher risk of developing overweight (OR&#x02019;s between 4.72; CI 1.31 to 17.04 and 2.03; CI 1.10-3.74) when compared to girls of high socioeconomic position. The risk of developing overweight or obesity during the follow-up period was not associated with parental socioeconomic position for boys.</p><p id="__p589">Conclusions: The levels of overweight and obesity among adolescents are high and continue to rise. Results from this study suggest that the social gradient in overweight becomes steeper for girls and emerge for boys in late adolescence (age span 15 to 21&#x000a0;years). Late adolescence seems to be an important window of opportunity in reducing the social inequality in overweight among Danish adolescents.</p><p id="__p590">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Camilla S.

Participants were 1111 children with a mean age of 10,13&#x000a0;years (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,29), 50,3% boys and 49,7% girls. The level of parental conflict was assessed by a five-point scale, in which children estimated the current relationship between his/her parents as very good, good, fair, poor, very poor. Quality of life was evaluated using the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition that examines the children perceived health in five dimensions: satisfaction (with self and health), comfort (emotional and physical symptoms and limitations), resilience (positive activities that promote health), risk avoidance (risky behaviors that influence future health) and achievement (social expectations in school and with peers). Results show a positive and significant relation in all dimensions, indicating that the more conflictive is the relationship between parents, the worse the quality of life (satisfaction: F&#x02009;=&#x02009;26.52, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.00; comfort: F&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.44, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.00; resilience: F&#x02009;=&#x02009;30.45, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.00; achievement: F&#x02009;=&#x02009;16.39, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.00; risk avoidance: F&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.77, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.00). Post hoc comparisons showed that significant differences were found between children who perceived the relationship between parents very good and those that considered it as good, fair, poor and very poor.

Objective: To investigate the relationship between somatization symptoms and psychosocial problems in children and adolescents receiving treatment in a pediatric Emergency Department (ED). Method: Three-hundred and fifty-eight patients (48.6% male, 51.4% female) were recruited from the ED at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Patients ranged from 8 to 18&#x000a0;years of age (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.8, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.9). Investigators conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional, multi-informant (child and caregiver) study. Pearson&#x02019;s product moment correlation coefficient was used to analyze relationships between somatization (pain/weakness, gastrointestinal, and pseudoneurological symptoms) and psychosocial problems (attention, internalizing, externalizing, and total psychosocial problems). Results: Pain/weakness symptoms were significantly correlated with attention (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.292, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), externalizing (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.242, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), internalizing (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.383, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), and total psychosocial problems (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.452, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Gastrointestinal symptoms also had a significant positive correlation with attention (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.304, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), externalizing (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.242, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), internalizing (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.383, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), and total psychosocial problems (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.452, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Pesudoneurological symptoms also had a positive significant relationship with attention (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.357, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), externalizing (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.211, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), internalizing (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.408, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), and total psychosocial problems (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.455, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Conclusion: All measures of somatization were associated with psychosocial problems. This demonstrates the importance of screening children and adolescents for somatization symptoms.

One theory regarding EE, particularly the criticism facet, is that it stems from attributions of internal control to the afflicted family member. Significant correlations between EE and misattributions have been found in a number of disorders including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and learning disabilities suggesting that correcting misattributions may in turn modify levels of EE, a positive predictor of relapse rates and a negative predictor of treatment compliance.</p><p id="__p611">Methods: Thirty four parent-adolescent dyads participating in a treatment study targeting adolescent overweight and obesity at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and at the University of Chicago participated in this study. Parents completed the Family Questionnaire to assess EE, and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale to assess attributions of their child&#x02019;s obesity. Data were collected at baseline assessment.</p><p id="__p612">Results: Linear regression analyses with parental BMI as a covariate indicated that parental internal locus of control regarding adolescent obesity was significant (beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.417, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.039) as a unique negative predictor of the criticism factor of EE.</p><p id="__p613">Discussion: Contrary to our hypothesis, increased attributions of obesity to a locus of control internal to the child were associated with reduced parental criticism. Though contradictory to literature on attributions and EE in other disorders and conditions, our findings are consistent with data on parental obesity indicating that overweight parents tend to be less alarmed regarding their overweight child. Notably, the majority (92.6%) of parents in our sample were overweight or obese. Given the concordance of overweight or obese status between parents and offspring in our sample, our findings may be attributed to parental identification leading to reduced negative expressed emotion.</p><p id="__p614">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Michal Munk, Bachelor of Arts, Clinical Psychology, Fairleigh Dickinson University, New York, NY, 10033; MichalMunk@gmail.com</p><p id="__p615">PSW-165</p><p id="__p616">PREDICTORS OF PSYCHOSOMATIC COMPLAINTS FOR JAPANESE STUDENTS OF HIGH SCHOOL WITH CORRESPONDENCE COURSES</p><p id="__p617">Yumiko Sakata, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Ryuta Kanemaru, MA,<sup>2</sup> Yuriko Takata, PhD<sup>1</sup> and Akemi Masuda, MA<sup>3</sup>\n</p><p id="__p618"><sup>1</sup>University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Ibaraki University, Mito, Japan and <sup>3</sup>Junior College, University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan.</p><p id="__p619">Introduction: In Japan, we have a unique system of high school education, which is called &#x0201c;Tsushinsei&#x0201d;. It means a high school with correspondence courses, and many students enter the school not because of the economical issue but the interpersonal issue. Since most of full-time high schools in Japan make much account of attendance in junior high school for admission, many students who have experienced school refusal select a school with correspondence courses. Thus, the schools have a lot of sensitive students who are easy to have psychosomatic problems, and the teachers need to pay attention to students&#x02019; early psychosomatic complaints in order to prevent the bigger educational problems such as dropout. This is the critical issue in Japanese &#x0201c;Tsushinsei&#x0201d; high schools with correspondence courses.</p><p id="__p620">Objectives: To clarify the factors affect students&#x02019; subjective symptoms in high schools with correspondence courses.</p><p id="__p621">Method: The subjects were 836 freshmen in a typical public high school with correspondence courses in Japan, who were surveyed over a 7-year period from 2003 to 2009. The survey was comprised of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), Takata-Sakata Psychosomatic Complaints Scale (PCS) and basic attributes.

Results of a recent meta-analysis revealed that perceptual-organizational abilities and visual-spatial functioning are domains of particular vulnerability. There have also been several reports of lower visual-motor drawing ability among children with complex congenital heart disease. Multiple medical and surgical variables have been recognized as impacting neurodevelopmental outcome for these children. Very few studies have specifically examined neurodevelopmental outcome for children with ventricular septal defects (VSDs), which are among the most common congenital heart problems with a rate of approximately one out of 500 births. This population is generally expected to have excellent medical outcome and typical development. As part of a larger study examining mid-term neurodevelopmental outcome for children VSDs surgically repaired in infancy, visual-motor ability was assessed among 31 children ages 3 to 16&#x000a0;years with a commonly used graphomotor drawing task. Whereas many areas of cognitive functioning, including full-scale IQ (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;95.6, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;15.3, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.12) were comparable to the general population (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;100, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;15), visual-motor ability was an area of weakness (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;87.9, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.2, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Additional results showed that household income and the presence of a comorbid medical condition were significant predictors of visual-motor ability. Specifically, lower income was associated with lower visual-motor scores (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.007). The presence of a comorbid medical condition was also associated with lower visual-motor ability (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.019). Twenty-two additional patient and surgical factors were also examined, with no other variables statistically related to visual-motor ability. This study shows that the weaknesses in visual-motor ability observed among children with more complex, cyanotic congenital heart disease are also found among children with repaired VSD. Furthermore, surgical factors do not appear to affect visual-motor ability among children with VSD.</p><p id="__p639">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Julie Simons, PhD, A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, 19803; jsimons@nemours.org</p><p id="__p640">PSW-168</p><p id="__p641">ADOLESCENT GIRLS ARE MORE BODY DISSATISFIED AND USED MORE COPING STRATEGIES IN STRESSFUL SITUATIONS</p><p id="__p642">Gisele Straatmann, Master and Sebasti&#x000e3;o S.

A sample of 166 girls and 47 boys, aged 15-18&#x000a0;years, was recruited from public high schools in Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, state of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil. The main outcome measures used were Figure Rating Scale, Lipp Stress Symptoms Inventory and The Ways of Coping Questionnaire. Descriptive analyses were performed. Correlational analyses tested the associations of body image, stress and coping with sex and BMI. Logistic regression analyses were conducted for each of the 8 coping strategies. The confidence intervals used were 95%. The results revealed that both boys and girls were dissatisfied with their body size and the majority overestimated it. The exception was the overweight adolescents that had significantly negative body distortion. Girls showed more body distortion than boys. The correlation between body dissatisfaction and body distortion was negative and moderate (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212; .65). A large proportion (55,86%) of adolescents are found to have significant stress symptoms. A greater proportion of females (61,40%) than males (36,20%) are found to have stress. Adolescents with stress had more probability using confrontive coping (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,14), distancing (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,09), seeking social support (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,33), self-controlling (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,06), accepting responsibility (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,40) and escape-avoidance (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,17) in a situation that involves body discomfort.

One modified procedure of the technique is &#x0201c;the twice-application method&#x0201d; of the tree drawing technique. The technique is administered by drawing a tree in the first picture and then immediately drawing a tree again in the second picture. It has been demonstrated that through this technique the subject expresses their self-image in two different projection levels&#x02014;&#x0201c;social attitude&#x0201d; in the first picture, and &#x0201c;internal self-image&#x0201d; in the second. However, little recent studies have addressed the validity of the technique. Therefore, the present study aims to examine the relationship between the twice-application method of the tree-drawing technique and ego identity.</p><p id="__p682">The participants were 277 university students who completed the twice-application method of the tree drawing technique and the ego identity status scales. In the present study, we scored the forms of the tree trunk drawing because the relationship between the indices in that element of the drawing and ego status has already been examined. The results of the ego identity status scales demonstrated that the subjects were distributed in identity statuses as follows: 15 identity achievements and 46 identity diffusions. The tree drawings of two groups were compared by chi-square tests. As a result of chi-square tests, we observed that identity-achieved individuals who drew a trunk at the center in the first picture with consecutive lines also drew a trunk of medium thickness in the second picture. On the other hand, identity-diffused individuals who drew a trunk on the left side or the right side with a considerably wide trunk base in the first picture also drew a trunk with discontinuous lines and a thin trunk in the second picture. These results reveal that the uncertainty and the conflicts of their self-images were expressed in the twice-application method of the tree drawing technique.</p><p id="__p683">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sato Hideyuki, MD, Rissho University, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, 141-8602, Japan; satohide@ris.ac.jp</p><p id="__p684">PSW-174a</p><p id="__p685">EFFECTS OF MEDIA AND SOCIAL STANDING ON SMOKING BEHAVIORS AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN CHINA</p><p id="__p686">Grace Huang, MPH,<sup>1</sup> Thomas W.

While many studies have documented the associations between peer influences and smoking behaviors in the U.S. (Hoffman et al, 2006) and among Chinese adolescents (Weiss et al., 2008) fewer studies have shown how these influences occur in relation to one&#x02019;s popularity and social status as measured by an individual&#x02019;s position in their social network. Furthermore, recent advances in social media channels now serve as an extension of one&#x02019;s social network and sphere of influence. Online social network sites such as Facebook (QQ in China) and mobile phone text messaging are rapidly gaining popularity. This study examines the interplay between these new media channels, peer influences, and smoking outcomes.</p><p id="__p689">Data were collected from 5,563 students from 24 professional and vocational high schools in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, China.

Reflecting the child&#x02019;s well-being across multiple domains, QOL captures well the broad meaning of health espoused by WHO. This research therefore examined whether there are race/ethnic disparities in QOL. A multi-site study enrolled 4,824 5th grade children from one of the three major race/ethnic groups in the U.S. (Hispanic&#x02009;=&#x02009;38%, African American&#x02009;=&#x02009;36%, White&#x02009;=&#x02009;26%). Children reported their QOL with the PedsQL providing scores for their physical and psychosocial domains, as well as with instruments to measure self-worth and social well-being. Parents rated children&#x02019;s overall health status and provided demographic information on the household. Complex sampling analysis revealed non-White children reporting significantly lower QOL in all domains than White children. However, after controlling for SES differences (parent&#x02019;s education, income), these race/ethnic disparities remained only in the domains of school, self-worth, satisfaction with appearance, and social well-being. After also controlling for family contextual differences (family structure, English proficiency), disparities remained in the domain of social well-being only. Findings suggest that disparities across race/ethnicity in children are, mainly, products of sociodemographic differences, rather than being endemic to minority race/ethnic groups. As one of the first studies examining racial/ethnic disparities in QOL of children in the general population, this study provides a basis for further exploration of contextual influences on the QOL experienced by children.</p><p id="__p697">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jan Wallander, PhD, University of California, Merced, Merced, CA, 95343; jwallander@ucmerced.edu</p><p id="__p698">PSW-174c</p><p id="__p699">FACTORS AFFECTING THE PSYCHOSOMATIC COMPLAINTS OF CORRESPONDENCE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS</p><p id="__p700">Akemi Masuda, MA,<sup>1</sup> Yuriko Takata, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Yumiko Sakata, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Reiko Sato, Master of Nursing<sup>3</sup> and Reka Takahashi, Master of Child Studies<sup>4</sup>\n</p><p id="__p701"><sup>1</sup>Nursing, Junior College, University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka city, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Doctoral Program in Life System Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences,, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan and <sup>4</sup>Doctoral Program in Nursing Sciences, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.</p><p id="__p702">Correspondence education was introduced into Japan from the United States in 1946, and many working young people used it to learn.

In addition to health complications (e.g., type 2 diabetes), adolescents who are obese are at risk for developing negative body image which is related to depression and is a risk factor for eating pathology. Having a supportive peer group is an essential part of healthy adolescent development, and for overweight adolescents, could be a protective factor against negative body image.</p><p id="__p712">PURPOSE: To examine whether the association between adolescent weight status and body image varies by peer support.</p><p id="__p713">METHODS: A US nationally-representative sample of 6,909 students in grades 6 -10 with over-sampling of African-American and Hispanic students completed the 2006 Health Behavior in School-aged Children survey. Body image, was assessed with 5 items (&#x003b1; = .87) asking for agreement or disagreement with statements about one&#x02019;s body. Weight status, determined from body mass index, was computed from self-reported height and weight and categorized using CDC 2000 growth charts. Peer support was computed as the average of 8 items (&#x003b1; = .67) asking about interactions with peers; higher scores indicated greater peer support. Linear regressions, separately by gender and controlling for age, race/ethnicity and socio-economic status, were conducted with an interaction term (weight status x peer support).</p><p id="__p714">RESULTS: Adolescents&#x02019; overweight status was related to poor body image in boys and girls. However, peer support moderated the relationship between weight status and body image for girls but not for boys. Overweight girls with higher peer support were more likely to have a positive body image (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.69, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.000) compared to overweight girls with lower peer support (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.99, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.000).

Physical activity habits that are established during adolescence are likely to be sustained into adulthood. However, the prevalence of PA among adolescents is low, and even lower among overweight/obese (OT) adolescents, who are most in need of the benefits conferred by PA. Body image may mediate this relationship; overweight/obese adolescents are more likely to suffer from poor body image, which could be linked to less engagement in PA.</p><p id="__p731">PURPOSE: To examine the hypothesis that poor body image mediates the relationship between overweight/obesity and PA among adolescents.</p><p id="__p732">METHODS: Data are from the 2006 Health Behaviors in School-Age Children survey, a nationally representative sample of students in grades 6-10 during the 2006 school-year. Physical activity was measured by a question asking about the number of days respondents engaged in at least 60 minutes of PA over the last week. Body image was assessed with 5 items (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.87) asking for agreement/disagreement with statements about one&#x02019;s body.

Most obvious are chronic health conditions (CHC), but the majority of children only experience temporary health problems (e.g., infection, injury). How do these variations in health status affect quality of life (QL) in children? QL reflects the child&#x02019;s overall well-being across multiple domains. There has been no study examining the relationship between compromised health and QL in children in the general population who do not have a CHC, nor do we know how such variation interacts with race/ethnic status. Our hypotheses are that (1) variation in health status is positively associated with QL regardless of the presence of CHC and (2) Whites report higher QL than African Americans and Hispanics, regardless of health status.</p><p id="__p741">A multi-site study enrolled 4,824 5th grade children from one of the three major race/ethnic groups in the U.S. (Hispanic&#x02009;=&#x02009;38%, African American&#x02009;=&#x02009;36%, White&#x02009;=&#x02009;26%). Children reported their QL with the PedsQL providing scores for their physical and psychosocial domains, as well as on instruments to measure self-worth and social well-being.

Moreover, African Americans and Hispanics report a lower QL than Whites, when in excellent health as well as at each decrement in health status.

Other researchers have proposed that educational expectations do actually predict educational outcomes among youth. They have found that having higher educational expectations is associated with higher educational outcomes later in life (Mello, 2008). However, researchers have not examined how educational expectations may be associated with adolescents&#x02019; self-reported sexual behaviors. Some researchers suggest that there might be a self-selection process in which adolescents who do worst in school and do not have plans to continue further in their education may also engage in unprotected sexual behavior, putting them at higher risk of becoming pregnant. In the present study we examined the relationship between educational expectations and goals and different sexual behavior outcomes in a sample of 829 Mexican youth. Participants included 829 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 (mean 15.18, S.D.&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.68, 55,4% females) part of an HIV and STDs intervention program. We examine this relationship using time 1 data. Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire that asked about their sexual behavior and explore different psychosocial predictors of sexual behavior. Using a regression analyses we examined whether having plans to complete high school and continue their education predicted ever had sex, age in which girls and boys should have sex for the first time, plans to use condoms when having sex, and perceive that condoms may be effective to protect them of STDs and HIV. Our findings suggest that plans to finish high school predicts only perceptions that condoms may be effective to protect against HIV (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,06, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), and not any of the other outcomes. Because we had very few participants who reported ever having sex (9,5%), we probably did not have enough power to find further differences. We explored how these variables may predict their sexual behavior at the 12&#x000a0;months follow-up, when 16% of participants reported ever having sex, and we found that having plans to attend college predicted not having sex among adolescents (Exp (B) = 0.358, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).

The activation level are thought to be an important mediator of the social skill and the depression. Obata et al. (2010) found that the difficulty in the control of social anxiety lead to the inhibition of social activity and the increase of depressive mood in Japanese high school students. We hypothesized that the mechanism for exacerbation of depression may be explained by the behavioral activation and social skill, and these relationships differed with the level of social anxiety. Method: Questionnaires were conducted with 347 Japanese adolescents (16.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6&#x000a0;years). Questionnaires were composed of Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRS; Birleson, 1981), Assertiveness Skill Scale for High school students (ASS; Takaki et al., 2002), and Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS; Martell et al., 2001). Higher score group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) and lower score group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) were extracted in subjects on &#x0201c;social anxiety(reverse coded)&#x0201d; in ASS. Data analyses were tested using correlation analysis to examine relationship of between depression , social skill, and behavioral activation, using SPSS 16.0.

The objective is to study the association between state anxiety with emotional quotient and strength and difficulty of the secondary school student who also study in Sunday Buddhism and do not study by controlling some potential confounding. The self-report questionnaire was distribution to both type of schools to student age 11-16&#x000a0;years old. The tools of this study are Thai version of state-trait anxiety of Spielberger&#x02019;s; the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ); emotional quotient (EQ). The regression model used for analyzing and the data are centered to reduce the scaling problem. The 303 completed answer questionnaire was returned, the incomplete questionnaire was excluded from the study to reduce the effect of imputation. Mean age of sample is 13.5&#x000a0;years old, 42.24% is male, and 48.51% reported that they are also study in the Sunday Buddhism School. The model by stepwise selection presents that trait anxiety, pro-social, self-control, ability to deal with problem, self-esteem, life-satisfaction and interaction between age and emotional problem, the adjusted R2 is 60.55% (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). The increasing one unit of trait anxiety, self-control, self-esteem and life-satisfaction increases 0.52, 0.10, 0.11 and 0.13 standardize unit of state anxiety, the higher standardize score of ability to deal with problem decrease 0.07 standardize unit of state anxiety. The interaction of emotional and age reduce the standardize score of state anxiety. The higher emotional problem score increased 0.27 standardize unit of state anxiety while age reduce 0.01 unit of state anxiety (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

These new actors, which exist alongside traditional arrangements between sovereign states and UN bodies, signal a sea change in the institutional arrangements in global health as well as a change in the norms, expectations and rules relating to the relationships between these new philanthropists.</p><p id="__p767">It has become clear, however, that the new institutions in global health have often failed to adequately evaluate their investments and program implementation. With such enormous investments, it is critical to better understand these new institutions, evaluate their strategies to promote global health and document the successes and failures of these efforts. We propose that rigorous qualitative research methodologies can explore and describe how global health actors and their associated mechanisms interact with complex health systems to yield optimal Results: Qualitative methods, particularly case research, can overcome the three main weaknesses of quantitatively-oriented public health research models: underestimating complexity, failing to incorporate context and an inability to engage in the &#x0201c;why&#x0201d; questions. Qualitative methods can better evaluate if the activities funded by new global health actors are best aligned to meet the objective of delivering high value care to patients.

In its aim and scope, it bears special relation to the applied fields of Behavioral Medicine and Health Psychology. Expanding upon a recent bibliometric analysis (Schui &#x00026; Krampen, in press), we trace the impact, Positive Psychology had on these larger fields by evaluating the corresponding literature found in the PsycINFO database. Analyses comprise a time span starting with the year 2000 (since when numerous contributions on Positive Psychology are available) until present day. Results show, that even by employing a wide bibliometric definition of Positive Psychology, the overlap with Behavioral Medicine is minimal (also because documents are rarely indexed as such), while that with Health Psychology is considerably larger (ca. 9%). Further analyses of the overlapping literature include temporal changes of the overlap since year 2000 (it was higher in the early 2000&#x02019;s), the authors&#x02019; national institutional affiliations, multiple authorships, most frequently used journals, publication types, methodology employed, and the semantic networks opened up by title words and APA-index terms, which are presented as text clouds. In sum, bibliometric results point to a potential for improvement when it comes to establishing Positive Psychology approaches within Health Psychology, and especially Behavioral Medicine. That potential should be realized, since the relationship of Positive Psychology to the health-related fields is already stronger than to other psychological disciplines.</p><p id="__p774">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Gabriel Schui, Dipl-Psych, Leibniz-Institute for Psychology Information (ZPID), Trier, 54295; gabriel.schui@zpid.de</p><p id="__p775">PSW-177a</p><p id="__p776">RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAL ERRORS AND THE PERSONALITY TRAITS OF NURSES</p><p id="__p777">Mayo Suzuki, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Risa Fukuda, Master,<sup>2</sup> Yuko Hayashi, PhD,<sup>3</sup> Chiharu Akazawa, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Tomoko Kawakami, bachelor,<sup>4</sup> Mari Azuma, bachelor,<sup>4</sup> Michio Takemoto, bachelor,<sup>5</sup> Setsuko Fujimoto, bachelor,<sup>6</sup> Shigeru Sakuraba, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Satoshi Sasayama, PhD<sup>2</sup> and Chiemi Hayashi, bachelor<sup>7</sup>\n</p><p id="__p778"><sup>1</sup>Bunri University of Hospitality, Sayama-shi, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto-shi, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki-shi, Japan; <sup>4</sup>Daini Okamoto General Hospital, Uji-shi, Japan; <sup>5</sup>Kyoto Kagaku co., LTD, Kyoto-shi, Japan; <sup>6</sup>Pulse Station co., LTD, Minato-ku, Japan and <sup>7</sup>Mitsubishi Kyoto Hospital, Kyoto-shi, Japan.</p><p id="__p779">Background and Purpose: Nurses are likely to carry out the final role in any given medical procedure.

The development of effective treatment initiatives aimed to help obese youth adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles is prudent. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of exercise intensity on obese adolescents&#x02019; enjoyment, satisfaction and program adherence. Thirty obese adolescents (female&#x02009;=&#x02009;20, BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;95th percentile; 10-16&#x000a0;years of age) were randomly assigned to either a moderate (HRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;40&#x02013;55%) or vigorous (HRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;60&#x02013;75%) supervised 12-week exercise training program. Satisfaction was measured through self-reported questionnaires assessing satisfaction with outcome progress and current state. Enjoyment was measured using the PACES self-report questionnaire. Adherence was assessed as a percentage of sessions attended. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed no significant time x group interaction effects (all ps&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.05). Significant time effects in the expected direction were found for satisfaction with outcome progress (F(1, 26) = 17.62, &#x003b7;2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.40, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), satisfaction with current state (F(1, 26) = 5.97, &#x003b7;2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.18, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and enjoyment (F(1, 26) = 9.4, &#x003b7;2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.27, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.005).

This session introduces a theory based multi-level intervention spanning a convenience sample of 16 sports (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;250 athletes) at a Midwestern University. This program provides athletes and staff education about sport-related nutritional issues for performance and recovery. Emphasis of this program is placed on choosing healthy foods and making positive behavior modifications. Several methods of data collection were used for this project. All athletes were given a validated knowledge and dietary practices survey that was based on the health belief model, the EAT 26 survey which screens for disordered eating behaviors was distributed, and body composition was also determined using a Tanita scale. All data was entered into SPSS 16.0. Statistical analysis was conducted using t-tests and descriptive statistics. Changes in baseline knowledge, dietary practices, and body composition data will be reported and discussed. Formative evaluation which includes adherence to program guidelines and recommendations for program improvement will also be reported. Based on the data and information collected Project Ignite shows substantial promise as a model program for improving collegiate athlete dietary practices and knowledge about sport nutrition related issues.</p><p id="__p806">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Amy Thompson, PhD, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, 43606; amy.thompson4@utoledo.edu</p><p id="__p807">PSW-180</p><p id="__p808">ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL AND METABOLIC SYNDROME</p><p id="__p809">Atsuko Nakazawa, MD,<sup>1</sup> Masako Shigeta, MD,<sup>2</sup> Hideko Noaki, Nutritionist,<sup>3</sup> Katsura Yamakado, Nurse<sup>4</sup> and Yoshiyuki Watanabe, MD, Professor<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p810"><sup>1</sup>Health center, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Department of Social Medicine and Cultural Sciences, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Department of Health and Nutrition, Kio University, Nara, Japan and <sup>4</sup>Division of Health Check-up, Kyoto First Red Cross Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.</p><p id="__p811">Background: Lifestyles that are associated with metabolic syndrome (MS) are affected by individual health locus of control (HLC).</p><p id="__p812">Objective: Association between HLC and the characteristics of MS were examined.</p><p id="__p813">Subjects and methods: Subjects were 200 people who underwent medical checkups. HLC was measured with 11 questions and subjects were asked about their motivation to improve lifestyle and the desire to receive health guidance. The MS components (i.e., blood pressure, waist circumference, glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were measured. The subjects were graded into 4 levels by the number of MS components (i.e.,0,1,2,3&#x0003e;). We reviewed the association between the levels of MS and HLC.</p><p id="__p814">Result: There were no significant differences in HLC between the levels of MS.

It is a problem that male with Level &#x0201c;3&#x0003e;&#x0201d; had lower motivation to improve lifestyle, possibly due to resignation or denial.

Main meals complying nutrition recommendations of the Defence Forces are served but snacks are available for purchase during free time. Research on conscripts&#x02019; eating habits is limited, suggesting they favor energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods such as fast food, pastries, soft drinks and confectionery.</p><p id="__p822">Aim: To study conscripts&#x02019; eating habits before and during military service.</p><p id="__p823">Materials and Methods: In 2007, data on eating habits of 290 17-21-year old men were collected by self-administrated questionnaire at two garrisons (in the south and in the north) and at two arrivals (winter, summer) 1&#x000a0;month prior to beginning of military service and at 6&#x000a0;months of service. Three indexes were formed to describe main dimensions of eating habits: Fibre Index (FibI), Sugar Index (SI) and Fat Index (FatI).</p><p id="__p824">Results: At six months of service, the weekly consumption frequencies of rye bread (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) and fruit and berries (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) increased. This explained the increase in FibI (change 0.65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.1, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). Weekly consumption frequencies of French fries (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) and hamburgers and hot dogs (pp&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) decreased. However, this did not result in a significant temporal change in FatI. Finally, weekly consumptions of sweet pastries (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002), desserts (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), sweets (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and chocolate (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) increased. This resulted in a significant increase in SI (change 2.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.8, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

This may be due to an overall increase in energy intake. Still, the increase of sugary foods offers an opportunity to intervene also as seasonal and regional differences exist.</p><p id="__p826">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Clarissa M.

Project Ignite is a nutrition education program designed to educate 250 collegiate athletes about eating for sport performance and avoiding injury associated with poor nutritional intake. Additionally, data such as body mass index, body-fat (measured with a Tanita scale), and knowledge and perceptions of sport nutrition was measured. All participants of this program completed the EAT 26 survey which has been found to be valid in measuring disordered eating. This presentation will outline 3 case studies of collegiate athletes with disordered eating. For confidentiality reasons all names of participants have been changed. Case studies will include 2 athletes with extremely low body-fat (4% for female; 2% male) and 1 athlete with extremely high body-fat (50% female). These case examples will discuss the need for health and nutrition policies that guide student-athlete participation in their respective sports when disordered eating is present. Moreover, there is a need for health education regarding proper nutrition for the athlete, coaches, team physicians, and athletic trainers. Further, many universities do not have polices that mandate when a collegiate athlete should be evaluated to determine the extent of any existing disordered eating behaviors or health conditions associated with their nutritional intake. When it is determined that an athlete has disordered eating behaviors or health risks there should be policies in place to determine player eligibility.</p><p id="__p838">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Amy Thompson, PhD, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, 43606; amy.thompson4@utoledo.edu</p><p id="__p839">PSW-184</p><p id="__p840">PARTICIPANT PERCEPTIONS OF A COMMUNITY-BASED LIFE COACHING AND PHARMACIST COUNSELING DIABETES INTERVENTION</p><p id="__p841">Landry L.

Group comparisons and regression analyses were conducted to investigate demographic differences in biological, psychosocial and disease care factors in youth with type 1 diabetes. Participants included 349 youth, aged 9 &#x02013; 17&#x000a0;years (79.9% Caucasian, 71.3% lived with two biological parents, M SES&#x02009;=&#x02009;46.24), recruited from endocrinology clinics in two major metropolitan areas. The 24-Hour Diabetes Care Interview was administered to assess specific disease care behaviors and a test of diabetes knowledge was used to measure parent and child disease information. Independent sample t-tests confirmed commonly reported ethnic differences in A1c, where African American youth had significantly higher A1c levels (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.84%) compared with Caucasian youth (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.25%). African American youth reported poorer disease care behaviors including fewer intensive insulin regimens, less frequent blood glucose monitoring and poorer dietary composition of carbohydrates and fats. Additionally, African American youth and parents had lower disease knowledge scores than Caucasian youth and parents. However, hierarchical multiple regression analyses that controlled for confounding influences of SES and parent marital status revealed most disease care differences attributed to ethnicity were better explained by SES. The only significant ethnic group difference that remained was a difference in diabetes knowledge; ethnicity explained an additional 8.3% variance and emerged as a significant predictor of diabetes knowledge (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.308, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) after controlling for SES and marital status.

Measures included demographic data, the Body Image Dissatisfaction Scale (BIDS) (Yamatsuta &#x00026; Nomura, 2007), and the Abnormal Eating Behavior Scale (AEBS) (Yamatsuta, Nakai, &#x00026; Nomura, 2009). BIDS measures the degree of body image dissatisfaction. It contains three lower-rank factors (divided into high and low groups on the basis of one&#x02019;s mean factor score) including &#x0201c;dissatisfaction with body plumpness,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;dissatisfaction with other people&#x02019;s opinions of one&#x02019;s own body,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dissatisfaction with one&#x02019;s own face.&#x0201d; AEBS comprises three lower-rank factors including &#x0201c;uncontrollable intake of excessive food,&#x0201d; (e.g., binge eating) &#x0201c;purging behavior,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;control of food intake&#x0201d; (e.g., diet behavior). According to the BMI classification, based on that of the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity (1994), 102 subjects (18.41%) were thin, 406 (73.29%) were normal, and 46 (8.30%) were obese. First, we examined the relation between the BMI and the BIDS and AEBS factor scores; a single-factor analysis of variance of factor scores was conducted on each BMI classification. The results showed a significant main effect of BMI&#x02019;s class in all the factor scores excluding the &#x0201c;uncontrollable intake of excessive food&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;purging behavior&#x0201d; factor scores, and we can infer that the latter two factors have little relation to the BMI levels. Thus, abnormal eating behavior that resembles an eating disorder might have little relation to the actual body type. Second, we examined the relation between the &#x0201c;uncontrollable intake of excessive food,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;purging behavior,&#x0201d; and the BIDS factor scores; a t test on the former two factor scores from among the BIDS lower-rank factor group was conducted. The results indicated high scorers on these two factors in the high &#x0201c;dissatisfaction with body plumpness&#x0201d; group (t(531) = |5.08|, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01; t(531) = |2.14|, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05); hence, purging behavior might not be only a consciousness of other people&#x02019;s opinions of one&#x02019;s own body but also the problem of self.

The following environments were targeted for intervention: before and after school waiting areas, outdoor recreation areas, gyms/cafeterias, break rooms, front offices, classrooms, and administrative offices. Using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement&#x02019;s Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) rapid improvement cycle process, we worked with stakeholder groups within each school to target small, temporary changes in each environment identified for change.</p><p id="__p886">Results: Environmental changes included: a &#x0201c;fruit at recess&#x0201d; program that eliminated outside food during morning recess and substituted cut fruit instead; jog-a-thon and prize walk fundraisers instead of cake walks and bake sales; using treasure chests with nonfood rewards in the classroom and principals&#x02019; offices; adding vegetables to traditional lunch entrees; and cutting all fruit offered during school meals. In addition to extensive behavioral observation, we measured the heights and weights of 457 children (2nd/3rd graders) in year 1 and were able to measure 367 in year 2 (80% retention rate). Although not significant, obesity rates (&#x0003e; 95th% BMI) did not change for intervention schools (22% to 21%) and increased in control schools (21% to 24%).

Depression and insulin resistance (IR) each are significant predictors of the development and progression of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and are evident years in advance of the frank hyperglycemia of diabetes. Depression is associated with factors that promote IR including inactivity, obesity, and hypercortisolemia. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis of depression-associated insulin resistance (DAIR). Seventy-six persons (mean age 52&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;years, 76% female, 39% Caucasian) with a provisional diagnosis of T2DM (i.e., not taking antihyperglycemic medication and meeting ADA criteria per study OGTT) were enrolled. Major depressive disorder (MDD) was diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. Depression symptom severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Sixteen patients could be classified as depressed (i.e. DSM-IV MDD and and a BDI score &#x02265;16) and 52 could be classified as non-depressed (i.e. no DSM-IV MDD and a BDI score &#x0003c;16). IR was derived from anthropometric measurements [body mass index (BMI)] and OGTT measurements [HOMA-IR, area under the curve for insulin (AUC-I)]. IR was uniformly higher but not statistically different in the depressed vs. nondepressed groups (BMI: 41.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.6 vs 37.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.4&#x000a0;kg*m-2, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09; HOMA-IR: 8.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.6 vs 5.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.8,p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.13; AUC-I: 180&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;123 vs 135&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;65 uU*mL-1*2&#x000a0;h, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20).

However, it appears that the results are not always kept for a long period of time, confirming the results of recent studies that found failure in 20% of bariatric surgeries.</p><p id="__p930">Objective: This study tries to understand factors related with failures, exploring obese expectations and their understanding of their role along this process.</p><p id="__p931">Method: Ten morbid obese were interviewed about the way they experienced their bariatric surgery, and the reasons and meanings of weight regain.

Lifestyle changes needed to accomplish the objectives are perceived ambiguously between no responsibility in the treatment and the recognition of the need to be active on the process.</p><p id="__p933">Conclusions: Unsuccessfulness in bariatric surgery seems to be related with defeat in the fight with food which happens in moments of greater emotionality.

Although psychosocial factors have been suggested to affect eating behavior, most previous studies were either in laboratory settings or with recalled self-reports. Therefore, valid relationships between food intake and psychosocial factors in daily life have not been fully understood. Recently, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in which subjects record their momentary symptoms using portable computers as electronic diaries, has been used as an appropriate method avoiding recall bias. In addition, we have developed and validated personal digital assistant (PDA)-based food diary with food photographs. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between food intake and psychosocial factors in healthy people in daily life, using EMA and the PDA-based food diary. Twenty subjects (age 23.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.2 yo) wore a watch-type computer for a week and recorded their momentary psychological stress, mood states and situational information into it several times a day including just before and after meals. They also recorded into the PDA-based food diary everything that they ate and drank. Multilevel modeling analyses revealed that energy intake when dining out was significantly more than that in the other situations (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.049) after controlling for meal types and that momentary depressive mood just before the meal was negatively associated with energy intake only for dinner (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045). The results suggested possible effects of situational and psychological factor on energy intake with ecological validity and nutritional accuracy.</p><p id="__p940">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hiroe Kikuchi, MD, PhD, Department of Psychosomatic Research, National Institute of Mental Health, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo, 1878553; kikuchih-tky@umin.ac.jp</p><p id="__p941">PSW-188i</p><p id="__p942">TRENDS IN THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND OBESITY IN PENNSYLVANIA ADULTS, 1995 - 2005</p><p id="__p943">Oralia G.

Methods: BRFSS data collected between 1995 and 2005 were used for this study. Key Measures: Diabetes prevalence was assessed by self-report of physician diagnosis. Obesity was assessed by body mass index (BMI) computed from self-report of height and weight. Analyses: State-level data for diabetes and associated obesity prevalence from 1995 to 2005 were reported by each year. The sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education) and the known disease risk factor obesity were reported for 1995-2005. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine associations between diabetes, sociodemographic and disease risk factors at two time points (1995 and 2005). Results: Diabetes prevalence in Pennsylvania, which increased from 5.7% in 1995 to 8.1% in 2005, followed national trends, but exceeded them each year by approximately 1%.

This study explores whether people of different BMI show different levels of anxiety, as measured with three different questionnaires, a 28-item Fear Checklist (Hernandez-Pozo, Calleja, Castillo, et al 2009), the Spanish translation of the Beck Anxiety Survey (Hernandez-Pozo, Castillo, Mata, et al 2010) and a questionnaire of recent potentially stressing events RPSE (Hernandez-Pozo, Cerezo, Macias, et al, 2010). 60 men and 60 women, ages 15 to 35, participated in the study, with BMI ranging from 15.05 to 38.28; 56 were underweight-normal (G1), and 64 were overweight-obese (G2). A behavioral measure for anxiety towards body weight and eating disorders consisted of a computerized discriminative 8 minutes test based on the emotional version of the Stroop task where thematic and neutral words were used as sample stimulus. Interference was computed by subtracting latencies to neutral words from latencies to thematic words, of the same length and lexical probability. Before and after the Stroop task, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored Additional self-report measures of eating disorders were recorded, by means of the Spanish version of the EAT26, CAR and SCOFF questionnaires. Results showed a significant difference between groups for RPSE (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.062, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001) with higher scores for the heavier group, and for Beck index (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.159, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001). Combining sex by BMI group significant differences were recorded for all three eating disorders questionnaires, with female heavier group scoring higher on CAR and SCOFF, and male lighter group scoring higher for EAT26. The puzzling finding was that no perceptual bias differences were registered for BMI groups by themselves nor combined by sex, that is, the only differences among them were in verbal self-reports. Heavier females exhibited the highest diastolic reactivity (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.05, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001).

A percentage of 47.4% of the students eat fruits less than 4 times/week , while the consume of vegetables less than 4 times/ week was recognized by 62.4% of the students. Eating fruits and vegetables decreased with age. Moreover the bivariate correlation analyses showed that the lower use of fruits and vegetables was associated with insufficient knowledge regarding the importance of fruits and vegetables and the quantity, which should be consumed each day, as well as with lower intention of consuming more fruits and vegetables in the future.

Participants included 614 nine year old boys (51%) and girls (49%). Three 24-hour dietary recalls were collected. Children&#x02019;s height, weight (used to calculate BMI) and %BF were measured. Physical fitness, reported family history of diabetes, and ethnicity were also collected. A previously published prediction equation was used to determine the validity of rEIs in these children to identify under-, plausible-, and over-reporters. Additionally, we examined the question of whether there is a difference in reporting by sex, ethnicity, BMI and %BF. On average, 18% of the children were at-risk of being overweight, 43% were already overweight at baseline, yet these children reported consuming fewer calories on average than recommended guidelines. Additionally, reported caloric intake in this cohort was negatively associated with BMI and % body fat. Using the previously described methods 49% of participants were identified as under-reporters, while 39% and 12% were identified as plausible- and over-reporters, respectively. On average, children reported caloric intakes that were almost 100% of pER when the sedentary category was assigned; Inactivity and excessive energy intake are important contributors to obesity. With the rising rates of obesity and diabetes in children, accurate measures of EI are needed for better understanding of the relationship between energy intake and health outcomes</p><p id="__p973">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Oralia G.

Nutritional labelling, especially of processed foods, is one population level intervention designed to achieve healthier food purchasing and consumption. A range of nutritional labels varying in information and format are being used but there is currently no consensus on the most effective labelling. A systematic literature review of the impact of nutritional labelling on behaviourally assessed food purchasing and consumption is in progress (Cochrane registration in progress). Pilot literature searches have identified 13 studies assessing behavioural outcomes and preliminary analyses conducted. Eight studies assessed the impact of labelling the calorie content of restaurant menu items and found no effect on purchasing from fast food restaurants but a reduction in calories purchased from non fast food restaurants and canteens. One study found more purchases of low fat options, labelled as such, from vending machines. Two studies assessed supermarkets purchases and, although finding no overall effect of nutritional labels, different effects of different labels were found. Specifically &#x0201c;traffic light&#x0201d; labels highlighting products with high levels of less healthy nutrients had no impact on purchasing compared to unlabelled products. In contrast, while &#x0201c;low trans fat&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;low calorie&#x0201d; labels resulted in more purchases of items thus labelled, &#x0201c;low fat&#x0201d; labels resulted in fewer purchases of items thus labelled. Finally, two related studies assessed the impact of &#x0201c;low fat&#x0201d; labels on consumption finding paradoxically greater consumption of products thus labelled with greater effects in those who were overweight. These results indicate that the impact of nutritional labels on food purchasing and consumption is modified by characteristics of the individual, of the food product labelled and of the label itself. The results further suggest that the purchase of healthier options will not necessarily result in healthier consumption. It is anticipated that the results of the full review will help to elucidate which labels most effectively promote healthy consumption across populations to inform the development of policy internationally.</p><p id="__p979">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Rachel A.

However, it is unknown whether interpersonal coaching promotes the utilization of handheld computers to self-monitor health behaviors and whether increased utilization is associated with increased weight loss. The aim of this study was to determine whether interpersonal coaching leads to increased utilization of handheld computers for self-monitoring and weight loss in lower income multi-ethnic women. Participant women, aged 43&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;yrs among whom 85% were employed, 51% had a combined family income &#x0003c;$40,000, 61% were married/cohabitating, 41% were African-American, 31% White, and 28% Hispanic were randomized to either: a) self-paced use of handheld system (eSolutions, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29); or b) use of the handheld system plus weekly interpersonal coaching sessions (eSolutions-Plus, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;25). At 12&#x000a0;weeks, tracking frequency was significantly higher in the eSolutions-Plus (mean: 36.6&#x000a0;days, SD: 20.9&#x000a0;days) compared to the eSolutions group (mean: 26.3&#x000a0;days, SD: 24.5&#x000a0;days, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05; mean tracking total: 31.6&#x000a0;days, SD: 23.6&#x000a0;days, range: 0-79&#x000a0;days).

However, little efforts have been made so far to test whether there are detectable behavioural differences in type II diabetics as compared to age matched healthy controls. Ultimatum Game and its versions have been used to assess economic behaviour such as rationality or fairness in distribution of reward. Prior studies have shown that endocrine status of an individual affects the offers made as well as acceptance levels in the ultimatum game. Individuals with low testosterone levels or high serotonin levels were shown to give as well as accept low offers which is economically more rational. Since both testosterone and serotonin are key players in type II diabetes, we examined whether the offers and acceptance levels of type II diabetics are different than age matched controls. A survey of 58 patients with type II diabetes and other metabolic syndrome disorders and 60 age matched healthy controls showed that the offers given by patients with type II diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were significantly lower than the control. BMI was poorly correlated with the economic behaviour. Further in this sample, the ultimatum game offer was a better predictor of type II diabetes than BMI.</p><p id="__p991">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Milind Watve, PhD, IISER, Pune, Pune, 411 021; milind@iiserpune.ac.in\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583833012016" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figl_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figl_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figl_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583833012016" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p992">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Michael Witth&#x000f6;ft, PhD, Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Mainz, Mainz, 55122; witthoef@uni-mainz.de</p><p id="__p993">PSW-191</p><p id="__p994">PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT OF THE JAPANESE VERSION OF BODY IMAGE CONCERNS INVENTORY</p><p id="__p995">Masanori Tanaka, MA,<sup>1</sup> Jun Tayama, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Tastuyuki Arimura, MA<sup>3</sup> and Masashi Sugawara, PhD<sup>1,4</sup>\n</p><p id="__p996"><sup>1</sup>Center for Total Human Education and Child Welfare, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Center for Health and Community Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan and <sup>4</sup>Faculty of Education, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.</p><p id="__p997">The purpose of this study was to develop the Japanese Version of Body Image Concerns Inventory (J-BICI), which is a brief self-rating scale to assess a body dysmorphic concerns. We evaluated the factor structure, reliability and validity of J-BICI. Subjects were 1218 normal undergraduate (male&#x02009;=&#x02009;709, female&#x02009;=&#x02009;518) students. They completed the J-BICI and some other related questionnaires (Dysmorphic concerns Examination; DCE, Self-rating Depression Scale; SDS, Drive for Thinness and Bulimia subscale of Eating Disorder Inventory-91; abbreviated EDI-91, Japanese 32item short version of Padua Inventory; J-PI32). Factor analysis using promax lotation method was carried out and identified three interpretable factors. These factors were as follows: safety behavior for one&#x02019;s own appearance flaws (factor1), avoidant behavior from one&#x02019;s own appearance flaws (factor2), negative evaluation for one&#x02019;s own appearance (factor3). These factors had high degrees of internal consistency (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.84-.91) and good test-retest reliability (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.79-88, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01; 3&#x000a0;weeks interval).

The subjects were followed for 7&#x000a0;years, and various characteristics and IBS symptoms were serially observed (28 times). The IBS incidence rate was calculated.</p><p id="__p1005">Results: During the 7&#x000a0;years, 61 non-patient IBS (59.17%) changed to IBS: 42 diarrhea-predominant types and 19 constipation-predominant types. All IBS symptoms disappeared in 35 non-patient IBS subjects (33.95%). According to quantification method II (discriminant analysis), seven factors (cognitive appraisal, stressor, stress coping style, three kinds of lifestyle habits and psychologically abuse) were adopted as a predictive model for IBS incidence and were confirmed as predictive of IBS.</p><p id="__p1006">Conclusions: The results of this research show that non-patient IBS is a changeable state that can change into IBS or persons without symptoms. Most of the non-patient IBS subjects who became asymptomatic had had symptoms for six months or less. Furthermore, the longer a non-patient IBS subject had symptoms, the higher the risk of a change to IBS became. The findings suggest the usefulness of identifying and approaching non-patient IBS as early as possible to prevent the onset of IBS. It must be noted that the persons surveyed in the present study had only the diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant types. Therefore, the findings of the present study are limited only these two types. Further study including the mixed type is needed.</p><p id="__p1007">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Yasushi Fujii, PhD, WASEDA University, Tokorozawa, 359-1192; fu-ya29@aoni.waseda.jp</p><p id="__p1008">PSW-192b</p><p id="__p1009">THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECEIVING THE DRUG OR PLACEBO DETERMINES THE SIZE OF THE DRUG OR PLACEBO RESPONSE IN IBS TRIALS</p><p id="__p1010">Paul Enck, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Lene Vase, PhD<sup>2</sup> and Sibylle Klosterhalfen, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1011"><sup>1</sup>Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospitals, Tuebingen, Germany and <sup>2</sup>Dept. of Psychology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark.</p><p id="__p1012">While placebo controlled trials are common in the evaluation of novel drugs, they have been questioned because of the ethical problems of withholding effective treatment in (pain) patients. As alternative, comparator controlled trials ave been proposed. Both however, differ in the likelihood of providing effective treatment: 50% and 100%, resp. Methods: We investigated whether the likelihood of receiving drug or placebo determines the size of the drug response and the size of the placebo response (DR, PR) in treatment studies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Results: In 92 published randomized placebo-controlled trials with more than 22.000 patients with IBS, 16 had a drug:placebo ratio of 2:1 or greater while the remaining were powered 1:1. Computing the overall DR and PR, both responses were lower with higher likelihood of receiving the drug (ratio 2:1 or higher), but the difference between DR and PR ("therapeutic gain") decreased. Ten of the 16 studies (4 with a 2:1 ratio, 3 with 3:1, and 3 with 4:1; total n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6484) were compared to 10 studies (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3782) of similar size (&#x0003e;80 patients per study arm) and design (drug trials with novel compounds) based on a standardized patient definition (according to Rome criteria), and with comparable (dichotomous) endpoints. Again, the placebo response decreased with increasing likelihood of receiving a drug from 37.6% (1:1) to 29.1% (4:1). Similarly, the drug response dropped from 49.8% (1:1) to 42.4% (4:1) (significant decrease for DR (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.035), but not for PR). Discrimination between DR and PR was best for 1:1 trials. Correlation between the drug response and the placebo response across all 20 trials was significant (Pearsons r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.781, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), but was higher in 1:1 trials (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.91, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) than in trials with a higher drug-to-placebo ratio (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10, r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.69, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.027). Conclusion: The higher the likelihood of receiving active treatment (a drug as compared to a placebo), the lower the response rate to both placebo and the drug in IBS, at the expense of a poorer discrimination between DR and PR. This is contrary to respective data from depression trials.

The aim of this study was to investigate pre- and postpartum levels of childbirth fear in a cohort of pregnant women and examine factors associated with elevated fear. Three hundred sixty-one pregnant women (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;32, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.5) completed questionnaires measuring: anxiety sensitivity, state-anxiety, fatigue, depression, social support, life events and parental self-efficacy in the third trimester of pregnancy. The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) was used to assess childbirth fear at the pre- and postpartum assessment. Two-hundred sixty-three women returned their questionnaires at the 4-6&#x000a0;weeks postpartum assessment. Demographic variables (i.e. parity, education) and complications in the current pregnancy or in previous deliveries were also collected. Low levels of childbirth fear during pregnancy was reported by 25.8% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;93) of the women, with 48.8% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;176) moderately fearful and 25.5% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;92) highly fearful. At the postpartum assessment 37.6% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;99) reported low levels of fear, 44.1% (n=116) reported moderate fear levels and 18.3% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) were highly fearful. Overall, fear levels in the postpartum decreased significantly by a mean of 6 points compared to the prepartum assessment (t (262) = 4.5, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). The regression model examining prepartum childbirth fear showed that lower parental self-efficacy (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), higher state-anxiety (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), more life events (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) and greater anxiety sensitivity (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003) were significant independent predictors of higher prepartum W-DEQ, explaining 44% of the variance. In addition to prepartum WEQ scores (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), postpartum childbirth fear was associated with greater anxiety sensitivity (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), lower parental self-efficacy (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) and delivery by caesarean section (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014), together explaining 36% of the variance. Our findings underscore the importance of routine assessment of childbirth fear during pregnancy and highlights areas which can be targeted in order to manage childbirth fear. Women expressing fears may benefit from interventions aimed at improving self-efficacy and reducing stress to enhance the pregnancy and childbirth experience.</p><p id="__p1029">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Deborah Da Costa, PhD, Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 1A1; deborah.dacosta@mcgill.ca</p><p id="__p1030">PSW-195</p><p id="__p1031">GET OUT OF YOUR MIND AND INTO YOUR BODY: MINDFULNESS AND THE TREATMENT OF FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION</p><p id="__p1032">R. Gina Silverstein, BA and Willoughby Britton, PhD</p><p id="__p1033">Brown University, Providence, RI.</p><p id="__p1034">Introduction: Recent studies show Female Sexual Dysfunction can be caused by an overemphasis on secondary self-analysis rather than direct experience of arousal. Training in mindfulness has been associated with decreases in self-judgment and enhanced body awareness. This controlled study assesses the impact of mindfulness training on reaction time for ratings of arousal to erotic stimuli and related psychological barriers to female sexual function.</p><p id="__p1035">Methods: Fifty-six college students (female&#x02009;=&#x02009;29) participated in either a 15-week course with mindfulness &#x0201c;meditation labs&#x0201d; in addition to didactic class time (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;35) or an active control class (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;21) with a similar format (didactic and experiential laboratory sessions). All participants engaged in computerized neuropsychological performance batteries pre- and post- intervention where they rated erotic and non-erotic photographs in terms of arousal and valence. Scores and reaction times of ratings were recorded. Participants also completed the Five Factors of Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al., 2006), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (Brown et al., 2003), the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis et al., 1983) and The Self Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) at the beginning and end of the semester.</p><p id="__p1036">Results: At baseline, female participants had a significantly slower reaction time in response to erotic photographs than males, t (52) = 2.5, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.013. At post-intervention testing, females who participated in the meditation labs significantly faster reaction times, t (12) = 2.8, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.016. This change was more than twice that of females in the control group (723.0 vs. 306.7 milliseconds). Scores related to self-judgment also decreased significantly more in female meditators than controls, F (1,15)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.8, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.045. The faster reaction times were correlated with this decrease in self-judgment (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.70, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.012 ) as well as an increase in self-kindness (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.84, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001). Additionally, female meditators showed improved scores in mindfulness, depression, anxiety, and combined clinical symptoms measures (all p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), but controls did not.</p><p id="__p1037">Conclusions: These results suggest that mindfulness training is associated with improvements in many of the psychological barriers to female desire, arousal, and satisfaction. Most notably, it was associated with faster reaction times when reporting arousal that correlated with decreases in self-judgment. Female meditators were ostensibly enabled to react to erotic stimuli with decreased judgment and self-evaluation, thus becoming more engaged in the direct experience of their own arousal. These data strongly support mindfulness as a promising treatment for FSD.</p><p id="__p1038">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: R.

We hypothesized that higher levels of depression, stress, and colon cancer worry (and lower levels of social support) would be associated with greater numbers of ACF among individuals at heightened risk for colon cancer. Sample and Methods: Participants were self-referred or referred by physicians from the Gastroenterology Clinic or Colon Cancer Prevention Program at the University of Connecticut Health Center for routine colonoscopy. A total of 93 individuals were consented (51% women; 49% men). Within two weeks prior to colonoscopy, participants completed measures assessing the psychosocial factors noted above. Individuals were also examined for ACF detection at colonoscopy. Regression beta weights were used to examine the association between the psychosocial variables and ACF. Results: Among women, higher levels of depression were associated with greater numbers of ACF (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.731, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.032) after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, stress, social support, and colon cancer worry.

These results suggest that although colon cancer affects men and women equally with regards to morbidity and mortality rates, there are important gender differences in how psychosocial factors impact colonic mucosa and perhaps colon cancer risk. Psychosocial interventions aimed at targeting these types of factors are warranted but need to consider the role of gender.</p><p id="__p1044">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Katherine O&#x02019;Leary, MA, Psychology, University of Connecticut, Vernon, CT, 06066; oleary.katie@gmail.com</p><p id="__p1045">PSW-196b</p><p id="__p1046">GENDER PATTERNS OF SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES IN PREMATURE MORTALITY: FOLLOW-UP OF THE HUNGARIAN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PANEL</p><p id="__p1047">Maria S.

We aimed to quantify the gender-socioeconomic status (SES) interaction on premature mortality and to analyse which psychosocial characteristics might explain the different gender patterns of socioeconomic inequalities in premature mortality in this respect in Hungary.</p><p id="__p1050">Methods: Men (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1130) and women (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1529), aged 40-69&#x000a0;years, participants in the Hungarian Epidemiological Panel (2002) were followed for 3.5&#x000a0;years for total mortality. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between several socioeconomic measures and death.</p><p id="__p1051">Results: During the follow-up 99 men (8.8%) and 53 women (3.5%) died. The age-adjusted hazard ratios and the Rothman&#x02019;s synergy indexes showed that socioeconomic factors (education, blue collar work, personal and family income, subjective social status, lack of car and computer) were more deleterious in men compared to women. Adjustment for severe depression resulted in the highest decrease in the regression coefficients for the association between socioeconomic factors and male premature mortality. There was no indication that depression would mediate between low SES and mortality in women. Work stress measures might partly mediate the effect of socioeconomic deprivation on male mortality, while social support seems to counterbalance the negative aspects of socioeconomic deprivation among women.</p><p id="__p1052">Conclusions: Middle-aged Hungarian men seem to be considerably more vulnerable to the chronic stress of material deprivation than women.

A sample of 619 Australian university students (330 men and 289 women, aged 17-25&#x000a0;years) were systematically assigned to four image exposure conditions: no models, muscular models, average-slim models, and average-large models. In each condition, participants viewed eight glamour advertisements created for the purpose of the study, rated the effectiveness of each advertisement, and then completed standardised measures of body image state. Advertisements were matched across conditions for product and general style. Men and women rated average-size male models as equally effective in advertisements as muscular models. Amongst the men, those exposed to average-size models had more positive body image than those viewing no models, with no difference from those viewing muscular models. Similar results were found for women. These findings suggest that average-size male models can promote positive body image and appeal to consumers.</p><p id="__p1059">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Christina Lee, PhD, School of Psychology, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, 4072; c.lee@psy.uq.edu.au</p><p id="__p1060">PSW-196d</p><p id="__p1061">WORK AND NON-WORK RELATED EXPLANATIONS FOR GENDER DIFFERENCE IN THE USE OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS</p><p id="__p1062">Mikko Laaksonen, PhD, Ossi Rahkonen, PhD and Eero Lahelma, PhD</p><p id="__p1063">Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.</p><p id="__p1064">Background: Mental health problems are often found to be more common among women than among men.

These data were linked with the prescription register of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for women as compared to men for the use of all psychoactive drugs (ATC codes in classes N05 and N06, excluding medication for dementia), antidepressants (N06A) and sleeping pills and sedatives (N05B and N05C) among younger (40-50 y) and older (&#x0003e;50&#x000a0;y employees) during three subsequent years.</p><p id="__p1066">Results: Among younger women the risk for using psychoactive drugs was only slightly larger than in men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01&#x02013;1.54).

Participants eligible for this line of research may not be aware of genetic biobanking research and reasons to participate. This disconnect between potential eligible participants and the importance of genetic biobank research may hinder progress in disease management. Qualitative studies are needed to identify factors that influence a multi-ethnic sample to participate in genetic biobanking research. Purpose: Project Diversity GATHER (Group discussions Around Themes on HEalthful genetic Research) examines health behaviors and factors that influence women&#x02019;s and men&#x02019;s participation in genetic biobanking research. A multi-ethnic sample was recruited to identify factors influencing research participation. Methodology: 85 women and 50 men from Texas completed an 89-item sociodemographic questionnaire and 60-minute non-ethnically or gendered matched focus group. Wegner&#x02019;s translation process model (1993) was used to indentify intra-and inter-cultural themes that influence participants&#x02019; participation in research. Participants&#x02019; characteristics were analyzed through descriptive analyses and qualitative themes categorized on 3 key focus group questions:1) research perceptions, 2) facilitating factors, and 3) barriers to participate into research. Results: 135 participants (63% female; mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;46.67, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.17, mean education&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.86; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.49) participated in 28 focus groups. The sample was 49.2% African-American, 36.2% White, 8.5% Other, 1.5% Asian, 2.3% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and 2.3% American Indian/Alaska native; 19.3% of participants reported a Latino heritage. 81.3% participants never heard of the term genetic biobanking. 67.4% of participants indicated that they would participate in genetic biobanking research vs. 93.6% before and after the group, respectively, (F(1,94) = 7.23, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.015). Two, 5, and 5 central themes were identified for research perceptions, facilitating factors, and barriers to research, respectively. All participants reported mistrust, privacy, and lack of knowledge as research barriers. The majority of participants reported addressing importance of research and (non)monetary incentives to increase research participation. Conclusions: Multi-ethic focus group themes highlight that educating the community about the importance of genetic biobanking research may increase research participation.</p><p id="__p1074">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Georita M.

Vital functions such as the timing of cell cycles or apoptosis depend on this intrinsic rhythm. In mammals, the cogwheels of this clock are contained in every single cell. These so-called clock genes control their own expression and the expression of clock-controlled genes via several feedback loops. One of these genes is Per1, a clock gene that disposes of a glucocorticoid-responsive element and is therefore most likely influenced by glucocorticoids. In humans, stress is associated with an increase in the glucocorticoid cortisol. Simultaneously, psychosocial stress is seen as a major factor in the etiology of numerous mental health problems. For this reason, we aimed to investigate first, the association of cortisol and hPER1 as well as hPER2, and second, the putative cortisol-mediated influence of acute and chronic psychosocial stress on the gene expression of the same two clock genes in thirty-one healthy men. Our findings suggest that first, cortisol strongly interacts with hPER1 and hPER2, and second, psychosocial stress influences the expression of hPER1 and hPER2. These results implicate a strong clinical relevance of stress on the human circadian rhythm.</p><p id="__p1080">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Elvira A.

It is unclear whether these measures will capture motives for seeking genetic susceptibility testing where gene variants are associated with small increases in disease risk. In a factorial study examining methods to convey low genetic risk for lung cancer to young smokers, we evaluated a 20-item measure of motives for or against genetic testing in 128 college smokers. Items were adapted from those used in other scales and unique items were generated by a panel of experts to assess the following domains: health behavior motivation/demotivation, altruism, uncertainty reduction, impact on perceived risk and worry, and curiosity about oneself and science. Eight items were correlated significantly with intentions to get tested (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Exploratory factor analysis of these eight items yielded two correlated factors (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.22, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01): maintaining personal health and curiosity about self and technology. These items formed a reliable scale (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;.70) that correlated with testing intentions (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.63, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). We also asked participants open-ended questions to assess additional reasons for and against testing. Overall, themes paralleled those in our quantitative survey, though participants offered the novel point that they would not want to be tested because the awareness that would come from testing would lead to less enjoyment of life. Prior scales used to assess motivations for testing did not include the construct of curiosity about oneself and technology. This may be unique to intentions to seek new susceptibility tests. Understanding the role of curiosity in test uptake could be informative for this and other novel technologies where health utility has yet to be established.</p><p id="__p1086">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Suzanne O&#x02019;Neill, PhD, Georgetown University, Washintgon, DC, 20007; sco4@georgetown.edu</p><p id="__p1087">PSW-200</p><p id="__p1088">5-HTTLPR POLYMORPHISM, EDUCATION, AND STRESS COPING IN A SAMPLE OF JAPANESE WORKERS</p><p id="__p1089">Norito Kawakami, MD,<sup>1</sup> Akiomi Inoue, MHSc,<sup>1</sup> Masao Ishizaki, MD,<sup>2</sup> Akihito Shimazu, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Masao Tsuchiya, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Mitsuyo Kuroda, MPH,<sup>1</sup> Akiko Kitazume, MHSc,<sup>1</sup> Miki Akiyama, PhD<sup>3</sup> and Masaji Tabata, MD<sup>4</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1090"><sup>1</sup>Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Social and Environmental Medicine, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Faculty of Healthcare, Tokyo Healthcare Universit, Tokyo, Japan and <sup>4</sup>Ishikawa Health Service Association, Kanazawa, Japan.</p><p id="__p1091">Aims: A previous studies have reported that the long variant of the serotonin transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism is associated with problem solving style of stress coping among males (Wilhelm et al. 2007).

The Biobank at Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC) in New York City has recruited almost 10,000 individuals from the diverse communities served by MSMC. Our overarching objective was to evaluate Biobank participants&#x02019; beliefs, knowledge and information needs regarding genetics research and genetic testing. A topic guide was developed and 6 focus groups were conducted with MSMC Biobank participants. The topic guide included questions on understanding of genetics, beliefs about genetics research, and attitudes towards personal and childhood genetic testing. Each focus group was recorded and subsequently transcribed for data analysis. The 6 focus groups comprised 43 participants: 21 were Hispanic, 18 African-American, 2 Caribbean/West Indian, 1 Asian, 1 White; ages ranged from 27 to 76; the median yearly household income was &#x0003c;$20,000. Participants&#x02019; reasons for participating in the Biobank included helping future generations, learning more about personal health and disease, and helping the community. Understanding of genetics research and genetics were limited. Participants were generally in favor of personal genetic testing, but expressed mixed views regarding genetic testing of children. Participants expressed that they wanted more information about genetics, and suggested various venues such as streets fairs and community centers as a means for disseminating such information. The results indicate that Biobank participants recruited from a predominantly low income, minority community hold positive views, but have low understanding, of genetics research and its applications. These findings highlight the need for appropriately targeted genetics education initiatives and community engagement in DNA Biobanks and other genetics research.</p><p id="__p1101">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Saskia Sanderson, PhD, Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029; saskia.sanderson@mssm.edu</p><p id="__p1102">PSW-202</p><p id="__p1103">THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIOTROPIC COGNITION ON MULTIPLE HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS</p><p id="__p1104">C.

Earlier studies with women found that high sociotropic cognition was associated with increased cardiovascular reactivity and sexual risk behavior. However, few studies have included men and the influence of sociotropy on other health risk behaviors has not been evaluated.</p><p id="__p1107">Purpose: To examine the influence of need for approval, measured by sociotropic cognition, on health risk behaviors, including sexual risk, alcohol, drug, and tobacco use, and disordered eating in young men and women.</p><p id="__p1108">Method: Participants were 236 college students who completed self-report measures of sociotropic cognition and health risk behaviors. It was hypothesized that higher sociotropic cognition would be associated with more alcohol, drug, and tobacco use, sexual risk behavior, and disordered eating. Multiple regression was used to examine these relationships.</p><p id="__p1109">Results: Sociotropic cognition predicted sex-related alcohol expectancies (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.16, t(201) = 2.24, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and negative consequences from drinking (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.14, t(209) = 2.11, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Sociotropic cognition was associated with being pressured into having sex (t(227) = 2.19, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), but not to recent intercourse or condom use. Sociotropic cognition predicted recent amphetamine (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.21, t(229) = 3.26, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and inhalant use (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.14, t(229) = 2.20, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), but was negatively associated with alcohol (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212; .13, t(229) = -2.01, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and marijuana use (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.14, t(229) = -2.09, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). There was no association with tobacco use. Sociotropic cognition predicted more body dissatisfaction (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.32, t(225) = 5.09, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and more disordered eating behavior (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.25, t(210) = 3.81, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), and was not associated with BMI or physical activity.</p><p id="__p1110">Conclusions: Sociotropic cognition appears to be an important correlate of interrelated health risk behaviors for men and women. Need for approval influences disordered eating behavior, drug use, problems with alcohol use, and some sexual risk behaviors. Cognitive and behavioral intervention strategies may be useful to address need for approval and its effect on these health risk behaviors.</p><p id="__p1111">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: C.

Previous research has suggested that weight stigma influences health behaviors. Vartanian &#x00026; Shaprow (2008) found that weight stigma was associated with exercise avoidance. Whereas positive comments can enhance a person&#x02019;s physical and mental well-being, negative comments from others, in the form of weight stigma, can be harmful.</p><p id="__p1117">The sample consisted of 120 female students from a mid-sized university (78% Caucasian). Their ages ranged from 18-22. The average BMI of the participants was 24.09 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.34, range 16.50 to 38.70). The online survey was hosted on the secure, encrypted website. Participants completed a questionnaire measuring mental health, social support, weight bias, diet and exercise habits, and diet and exercise-avoidance motivation.</p><p id="__p1118">A meditational model was hypothesized. The three constructs of interest were significantly correlated (BMI and exercise avoidance, .47***; BMI and weight stigma, .50***; weight stigma and exercise avoidance, .51***). The primary model examined hypothesized that weight stigma would mediate the relationship between exercise avoidance and BMI. The model testing the relationship between the IV (BMI) and the DV (exercise avoidance) fit the data well. The models testing the relationship between the mediator (weight stigma) and the DV, and the relationship between the IV and the mediator, also fit the data well. The final model testing weight stigma&#x02019;s meditational role between BMI and exercise avoidance, found that weight stigma completely mediated the relationship between the IV and DV.</p><p id="__p1119">The results indicated that as BMI increased exercise avoidance increased. Similar to other studies with college females, as BMI increased perceptions of weight stigma also increased. Not only were BMI, exercise avoidance, and weight stigma all related in college females, but weight stigma mediated the relationship between BMI and exercise avoidance, indicating that weight stigma may predict adverse health behaviors.

Due to high rates and detrimental health consequences of negative health behaviors, it is important to identify factors influencing discounting rates. Personality dimensions and depressive symptoms have been identified as potential predictors of discounting rates, but past studies have utilized monetary discounting measures when examining health outcomes rather than health discounting measures. This study examined personality and affective predictors of health discounting in a sample of 97 undergraduate students (41 women) who completed the following questionnaires as participants in a study for course credit: (1) a hypothetical health choice task (Chapman, 1996), (2) the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and (3) the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Hypothetical health choice responses were summed, with higher scores reflecting less discounting of future health rewards. Data were analyzed with Pearson correlations evaluating factors associated with health discounting. Results indicated that higher extraversion was associated with greater likelihood of choosing delayed rewards (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.26, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01). However, analysis of sex differences indicated that the association was only significant among men (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.29, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03). Discounting was not associated with any other personality dimension, but it was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.32, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.002), indicating that greater depressive symptoms were associated with choosing immediate rewards. Analysis of sex differences indicated that the association was significant among men (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.37, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.005), but not among women. Unlike previous studies using monetary measures of discounting, these results indicate that extraversion among men may be associated with reduced risk of engaging in negative health behaviors, and that depressive symptoms among men may be associated with increased risk of engaging in negative health behaviors.</p><p id="__p1126">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Erin A.

Many researchers have tried to understand the reasons underlying people&#x02019;s decisions to seek or not to seek help. In these studies, measures of help-seeking intentions have been often used instead of measuring actual help-seeking behavior, because it is assumed that help-seeking intentions associate with actual help-seeking behavior. However, there is little evidence of this association. The purpose of this study is to examine whether help-seeking intentions can predict actual help-seeking behavior among Japanese university students. One hundred and eighty-five Japanese university students answered a questionnaire which included social support and help-seeking intentions (Time1). Four weeks later (Time2), participants answered another questionnaire which included psychological distress and actual help-seeking behavior. The correlation between help-seeking intentions at Time1 and actual help-seeking behavior at Time2 was moderate (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.65 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). The result of multiple regression analysis indicated that help-seeking intentions associated with actual help-seeking behavior (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.42 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Social support at Time1 (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.18 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and psychological distress at Time2 (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.44 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01) also associated with actual help-seeking behavior. These variables accounted for 57.2% of the variance in actual help-seeking behavior. Thus, it was revealed that help-seeking intentions can predict actual help-seeking behavior among Japanese university students.</p><p id="__p1132">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Nagai Satoru, PhD, Rissho University, Shinagawa-ku, 141-8602, JAPAN; nagai-st@ris.ac.jp</p><p id="__p1133">PSW-206</p><p id="__p1134">EFFECTS OF EXPRESSIVE WRITING INTERVENTION (EWI) ON INFERTILITY-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN COUPLES UNDERGOING IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF) TREATMENT - A FEASIBILITY STUDY</p><p id="__p1135">Yoon Frederiksen, MSc Psychology,<sup>1</sup> Signe M.

According to Temporal Self-Regulation Theory (Hall &#x00026; Fong, 2007), executive function (including working memory and inhibitory control capacities) and prepotent behaviour (e.g., habits) may influence self-regulation abilities. The aim of this study was to replicate and extend initial evidence (Hall, Fong, Epp, &#x00026; Elias, 2008) that, within the domains of diet and exercise, executive function moderates the intention-behaviour relationship. At baseline, university students and staff (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;123; ages 17-73; 33 men) completed an n-back task (working memory), a Go/NoGo task (inhibitory control), and measures of dichotomous thinking and weight-cycling. They completed weekly measures of diet and exercise intentions and behaviours (including a modified version of the US National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable screener over three weeks. Diet behaviours included eating five fruit and vegetables a day, low-fat foods, low-sugar foods, and a reduced-calorie diet. Regression analyses revealed interaction effects of executive function and intentions on reduced-calorie diet at Time 2 (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.14, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), and on fruit and vegetable intake and low-sugar intake at Times 2 and 3 (&#x003b2;&#x02019;s&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.18, p&#x02019;s&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Intentions were more predictive of behaviour when executive functions was high than when it was low. Weight-cyclers (compared to those with no history of weight cycling) reported a higher dichotomous thinking style (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.09, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.04) and exhibited lower levels of inhibitory control (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.14, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.04). The findings support hypotheses that health goal achievement is influenced by self-regulation abilities with a significant biological basis. Research is needed to identify ways to increase these self-regulation capacities or develop alternative techniques for enabling individuals with low executive function to fulfil their health behaviour intentions.</p><p id="__p1147">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Tamasin A.

However, new genetic technologies facilitate testing that can reveal personal genetic risk information about many different conditions simultaneously. These tests are already available to the public despite little understanding of the cognitive and affective factors that affect peoples&#x02019; decisions to take them. This study was conducted with 270 participants recruited from a parent study, the Multiplex Initiative, who were offered a multiplex genetic test that assessed risk for eight conditions: type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and several types of cancer and cardiovascular conditions. Data was collected from a baseline survey, a web-based decisional survey, and at the time of testing. We aimed to understand relationships among predictor variables that originated from a conceptual model; an amalgamation of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Protection Motivation Theory. Structural equation modeling identified response efficacy as a predictor (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.30, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) of attitudes toward multiplex genetic testing, which in turn predicted (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) intentions toward testing. Older age had a positive effect on testing intentions (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.60, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.040), while marginally significant effects on intentions were seen for higher educational levels (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.34, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.078) and African Americans (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.56, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.054). Furthermore, intentions to undergo testing were a strong predictor of testing behavior (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.87, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). These findings support the use of variables from the Theory of Planned Behavior in modeling decision-making about a genetic test for multiple health conditions.</p><p id="__p1153">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Barbara B.

To develop predictive models of social problem-solving (SPS) in this group, we conducted a secondary analysis using baseline data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial on weight loss. The total score and five subscale scores (rational and negative problem orientation [RPO, NPO], rational problem solving [RPS], impulsive/careless style [ICS], and avoidance style [AS]) of the Social Problem-Solving Inventory- Revised (SPSI-R) were used to assess SPS. Guided by the literature, we examined the following predictors of SPS: age, gender, education, marital status, employment status, income, mental health quality of life (MHQOL), perceived stress, and barriers to healthy eating (BHE). Predictive models were developed using all possible subsets regression in SAS. The sample was predominantly white (84.8%), female (78.1%), and middle-aged (average 46.80&#x000a0;years). Age, baseline weight, MHQOL, BHE, and perceived stress were jointly identified as predictors of the total score of SPSI-R (R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.40, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;26.4, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001).

Higher levels of income and education, fewer perceived stresses, and history of weight cycling predicted RPS (R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.34, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.7, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001), while a higher income, fewer barriers and perceived stresses predicted RPO (R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.22, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;23.8, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001). Less education, more eating barriers and perceived stress predicted an impulsive style (R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.18, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.7, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001), while being older, having poor mental health and perceiving more eating barriers and stress together predicted an avoidant style (R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.34, F&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.7, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001) of problem solving. Taken together, age, income, education, mental health, perceived stress, and barriers to healthy eating were associated with participants&#x02019; social problem-solving. These factors need to be considered when developing interventions to address problem-solving ability related to managing lifestyle changes and weight reduction.</p><p id="__p1178">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jing Wang, BSN, PhDc, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261; jiw38@pitt.edu</p><p id="__p1179">PSW-213b</p><p id="__p1180">WALK AWAY FROM THE HABIT: OVERCOMING NICOTINE DEPENDENCE THROUGH EXERCISE</p><p id="__p1181">Sarah E.

Most smokers who quit relapse within three months, suggesting that mainstream cessation assistance options do not work well for many smokers. Interventions using sustained, aerobic exercise as a smoking cessation technique have resulted in success rates comparable to conventional cessation methods. No trial to date has prescribed intermittent bouts of brief exercise in response to nicotine cravings, despite evidence suggesting its potential efficacy as a cessation tool.</p><p id="__p1184">This randomized controlled trial attempts to replace smoking with exercise when cravings arise among generally healthy, inactive adult smokers who desire to quit. The first wave of participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;26; mean age 42.4[12.2] years; 50% female) were randomly assigned to a standard care Internet group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) or an Internet&#x02009;+&#x02009;exercise group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) for the three-month intervention phase. The attrition rate (34.6%) was comparable to other smoking cessation trials and did not differ between groups. Self-reported quit rates among retained (29.4%) and total enrolled (19.2%) participants were higher than and comparable to, respectively, those attained by trials using traditional quit assist methods such as nicotine replacement therapy. Reduction rates among retained (49%) and total enrolled (37.4%) participants were substantial. Quit rates did not differ between groups, but reduction rates were twice as high among participants in the control (52%) vs. intervention (26%) group. From baseline to post-intervention, mean FTND scores (5.1[2.7] vs. 2.9[3.2]) and mean body mass (80.8[20.7] kg vs. 78.9[18.3] kg) decreased among retained participants and did not differ between groups.</p><p id="__p1185">Preliminary results from the first wave of participants in this low-cost, web-based trial are comparable to more resource- and time-consuming cessation programs, suggesting that future iterations of this program may be quite promising.

This study set out to explore the perspectives of patients&#x02019; management of Type 2 diabetes and provide recommendations that aim to enhance adherence to treatment and help patients to improve their self-management skills. In-depth interviews were carried out on a purposeful sample of patients and their health care professional (HCPs). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and audiotapes were analysed using NVivo software to identify emerging themes and code according to categories. Interviews were conducted in an Endocrinology clinic in Malaysia with 18 Malay patients (15-75&#x000a0;years, 9 males and 9 females) and 13 HCPs. Themes that emerged from interviews with patients&#x02019; were problems with integrating the treatment regimen and difficulty developing coping skills to achieve the desired blood glucose level. Patients lacked knowledge about their medicines, dietary control, medicine taking, complexities of treatment, and side effects of medications. They needed to integrate many treatment requirements such as diet, medications, blood glucose monitoring and exercise into their daily routine posed problems. Other barriers such as ethnicity, beliefs (culture and financial) proved to be constraints in their ability to good control diabetes. Education and knowledge related to diabetes that influenced understanding of the disease were also reasons for non-adherence to treatment regimen. According to pharmacists, patients&#x02019; ethnicity and education level played a substantial role in their attitudes toward diabetes management. Their beliefs, cultural and social needs shaped their attitudes in controlling or adherence to treatment management. Patients were willing to discuss their problems about self-managing diabetes if these barriers were addressed during consultations with the pharmacists. More positive approaches are needed in self-management of diabetes and health care professionals involved in the management of diabetes need to understand their patients&#x02019; beliefs about their diabetes and their constraints to promote more awareness and to foster greater control of diabetes and improve health outcomes.</p><p id="__p1192">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Salmaih Mohd Ali, BPharm, PhD, Clinical Pharmacy, Universiti teknologi MARA, Puncak Alam, 42300; drsalmiah@salam.uitm.edu.my</p><p id="__p1193">PSW-213d</p><p id="__p1194">PREVALENCE OF CO-MORBID MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS IN A HEALTH PLAN POPULATION</p><p id="__p1195">Jennifer McClure, PhD, Evette Ludman, PhD, Sheryl Catz, PhD, Karin Riggs, MSW, Jackie St. John, BA, Julie Richards, MPH and Lou Groathuas, MS</p><p id="__p1196">Group Health Research Institute, Seattle, WA.</p><p id="__p1197">Most major chronic diseases are caused by more than one behavioral risk factor and risk factors additively contribute to morbidity and mortality. Risk behaviors also tend to co-occur, but data on the prevalence of co-occurring mental and behavioral risk factors are scarce. Most prevalence reports focus on single risk factors. Better understanding the co-occurrence of risk factors, however, could help inform the feasibility and design of multiple risk factor (MRF) interventions, which potentially can be more cost-effective than delivering interventions targeted at single behaviors. We report on the co-occurrence of three primary disease risk factors (depression, low physical activity, and smoking) in a representative health plan population (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;66,901) in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Data was collected during an online health risk assessment offered to all health plan members. Two-thirds of respondents (66.6%) were female and 86% were white. Mean age was 47&#x000a0;years. Approximately 9% reported current smoking, 8.2% were moderate to severely depressed based on the PHQ-8, and 24.5% reported low physical activity per the IPAQ. While 33.1% of smokers had low physical activity and 18.8% reported significant depressive symptoms, the overall prevalence of all three behaviors was much lower. As a proportion of the entire sample, &#x0003c;2% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1089) met criteria for smoking and depression; 2.5% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1695) met criteria for smoking and low physical activity; and 3.2% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2137) met criteria for depression and low physical activity. Fewer (0.6%; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;405) met criteria for all three behaviors. The results highlight a challenge of MRF interventions. While many people report single risk factors, far fewer meet criteria for MRF&#x02019;s, even for common risk factors such as smoking, depression, and inactivity. Given this, MRF interventions may need to be easily disseminable across large populations in order to be cost-effective and have maximum impact. Implications for MRF treatment design will also be discussed.</p><p id="__p1198">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jennifer McClure, PhD, Group Health Research Institute, Seattle, WA, 98101; mcclure.j@ghc.org</p><p id="__p1199">PSW-213e</p><p id="__p1200">CHANGES IN DIET IMPACT SUBJECTIVE, BUT NOT OBJECTIVE, HEALTH OUTCOMES IN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS</p><p id="__p1201">Andrew J.

A goal of the BETRHEART Study is to determine how changes in diet such as fluid and salty food intake and poor ingredient awareness impact subjective and objective health outcomes in HF patients.</p><p id="__p1204">Methods: Sixty-three HF patients (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;54.4&#x02009;+&#x02009;11.5&#x000a0;years, ejection fraction&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;40) were examined at baseline and 3&#x000a0;months later. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) measuring subjective symptom reporting and a standardized Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) assessing functional status were administered. Hospitalizations were noted for up to 12&#x000a0;months after baseline; plasma levels of b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a marker of ventricular wall stretch, were determined. A Dietary Compliance Survey assessed how often patients avoided salty food, read food labels for sodium content, drank fluids, and recently ate salty foods.</p><p id="__p1205">Results: No significant differences between baseline and 3&#x000a0;months were found in the number of times patients avoided salty food (6.00&#x02009;+&#x02009;8.5 vs. 4.24&#x02009;+&#x02009;3.7), label reading (2.60&#x02009;+&#x02009;1.8 vs. 2.4&#x02009;+&#x02009;1.6), or salty food intake (6.89&#x02009;+&#x02009;10.2 vs. 4.24&#x02009;+&#x02009;3.7). The number of times that patients drank less than 2 quarts of water significantly decreased (3.92&#x02009;+&#x02009;1.3 vs. 3.08&#x02009;+&#x02009;1.7, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.009). After controlling for covariates (age, body mass index, gender, smoking status, diabetic status, serum creatinine, and prior myocardial infarction), increases in salty food intake were significantly related to worsening of subjective HF symptoms (KCCQ Overall Summary Symptom score, standardized &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.34, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05, adjusted R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.22). Associations between changes in dietary measures and changes in BNP, the 6MWT, or any other KCCQ subscales were not significant.</p><p id="__p1206">Conclusions: Baseline dietary behaviors did not predict future hospitalizations. Salt and fluid intake may influence cardiovascular functioning although the HF patients in this study only reported a worsening of overall subjective HF symptoms in association with increased salt intake over a 3&#x000a0;month period. These findings may be explained in part by imprecise self-reporting of actual eating behavior or by socially desirable responding.</p><p id="__p1207">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Andrew J.

The aim of this study is to verify if perceived regularity in the adoption of behaviour adds to the prediction of intention, taking into account the constructs of the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991) and constructs of other relevant social cognitive theories that aim to explain intention.</p><p id="__p1213">Method: This is a descriptive correlational design in which 385 college students in Quebec (Canada) volunteered to complete a self-administered questionnaire measuring psychosocial constructs (intention, attitude, subjective norm, descriptive norm, perceived behavioural control, self-efficacy) regarding the consumption of at least five portions of vegetables and fruit every day during the next three months. Consumption of vegetables and fruit in the last seven days and the regularity of this consumption were also measured. The Cronbach alpha of each construct was satisfactory, with values ranging from .62 to .94. A hierarchical multiple regression was used to analysis the data.</p><p id="__p1214">Findings: The findings indicate that attitude, descriptive norm, perceived behavioural control, self-efficacy and past behaviour explain 77% of the variance in intention. When perceived regularity is added to the model, 79% of the variance in intention is explained F (6, 378) = 247.16, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.00. In this latter model, perceived regularity is the second most important predictor of intention, after perceived behavioural control.</p><p id="__p1215">Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that perceived regularity of behaviour contributes significantly to the prediction of intention after the influence of psychosocial constructs of main social cognitive theories have been controlled.

One study has reported reduced mortality in persons with HIV disease reporting high positive affect; however, little is known about mechanisms of this effect. The broaden-and-build model of positive emotions holds that positive emotions promote psychological resource development (e.g. coping skills). The present correlational study conceptualized health behavior practices as coping responses to living with HIV disease. Specifically, medication adherence and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and nutrition) were hypothesized to mediate relations between trait positive and negative affect and general and HIV-specific health indicators in persons living with HIV. HIV + participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;53) completed an interview about their emotions, health behaviors, and general health status. Clinical staff provided HIV symptom ratings. Virulogic and immunologic indicators were collected by chart review. High trait negative affect was associated with poor medication adherence, and percent adherence mediated the relation between high trait negative affect and low CD4+ percent (z&#x02019;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1.33, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01) and high viral load (z&#x02019;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.61, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Mediation hypotheses for health behaviors were not confirmed; however, high trait positive affect was associated with decreased alcohol intake (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.10, R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.26, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.35, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), increased physical activity (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.89, R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.24, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.39, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), and better nutrition habits (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.68, R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.22, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.34, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Because the current sample was relatively young (average age 44, range 22-56), these behaviors may not yet had demonstrable effects on participants&#x02019; health status; however, future longitudinal studies or studies that target older populations may bear out these mediating hypotheses. The current findings provide preliminary evidence on potential mechanisms by which trait affect could impact health status in persons with HIV.</p><p id="__p1222">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Karen E.

Behavioral medicine has been defined as interdisciplinary field that integrates behavioral &#x00026; medical knowledge and applies that knowledge to health &#x00026; disease. In Libya behavioral medicine is a pretty unknown field of knowledge and as has been defined here is not exist due to many and multiple factors, therefore it is not surprising that you would not find a teaching curriculum in medical schools for psychology or behavioral medicine at any university in Libya before 1988, we can say that the teaching of behavioral sciences started in 1988 in the faculty of medicine in Tripoli, University of Al-Fatah as apart of the community medicine course and is taught in the fourth year. in the faculty of medicine in Benghazi ,psychology was part of pre medical curriculum but behavioral medicine taught in the 4th year as apart of community medicine course. In this paper. the author highlight the historical development of behavioral medicine and behavioral sciences in Libyan medical schools and suggestion to include behavior medicine in the Libyan medical curriculum which should be a compulsory and not an optional subject. The main objective and the primary massage of this paper is to emphasize that modern and successful physicians needs two types of knowledge &#x00026; practices: 1-medical &#x00026; biological knowledge. 2 - psychological and sociological &#x00026; practices knowledge.

This limits the possibility of replicating effective interventions, synthesising evidence, and understanding the causal mechanisms underlying behavior change. Our ultimate aim is to develop a reliable method of specifying behavior change techniques (BCTs), link them to relevant theory and specify the behaviors necessary to implement them. In several stages, we have generated lists of BCT labels based on a) systematic reviews of behavior change interventions b) systematic text-book search c) expert brainstorming. We have generated definitions a) from 9 textbooks, b) from dictionaries (including APA Dictionary of Psychology) and c) by reframing to specify the behavioral competencies required of the person implementing the BCT. Two judges had 74.7% agreement on definitions extracted from textbooks for 53 BCTs. When judging links between BCTs and theoretical constructs, four judges had 71.7% agreement (385 judgments, based on 35 BCTs and 11 theoretical constructs). To date, we have agreed behavioral specification for 89 BCTs relevant to changing health behaviors. However this is a very early stage in the process and we have recently acquired UK Medical Research Council support to develop an international collaboration to refine and develop a BCT nomenclature, based on extensive Delphi, consensus and judgment processes, and then to test the value of the developed system in increasing the reliability of a) coding of published interventions and b) reporting of interventions.</p><p id="__p1243">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Marie Johnston, PhD, Health Psychology, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, AB; m.johnston@abdn.ac.uk</p><p id="__p1244">PSW-213k</p><p id="__p1245">BEYOND &#x02018;LIFESTYLES&#x02019; FACTORS: A BROAD APPROACH TO PREVENTION OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN PERI-URBAN SOUTH AFRICA</p><p id="__p1246">Thandi M.

SC was defined as a function of both the number of self-aspects and the degree to which the self-aspects are differentiated from each other. Linville (1987) has suggested that high self-complexity serves as a buffer against the onset of depressive symptoms following negative events because it partly determines the impact of such events on thoughts and feelings about various self-aspects. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) or the control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20). The intervention group received one session of psycho-education on SC and a paper-and-pencil exercise designed to calculate the number of their self-aspects (social roles, interpersonal relationships, activities, traits, etc.) and to evaluate each self-aspect using an adjective checklist. After the education and exercise, daily records of their self-aspects were assigned for one week. Self-reported questionnaires were completed three times in both groups (pre, post, and follow-up). The questionnaire was comprised of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. SC, P-SC, and N-SC, which were assessed using H, a statistical measure of dispersion that represents number of independent dimensions underlying a given trait-sorting, were measured by Linville&#x02019;s (1987) and Sato&#x02019;s (1999) trait sorting task. The Research Ethics Committee of the Hiroshima University Graduate School of Education reviewed and approved the study protocol. In the intervention group, the analysis of variance indicated that P-SC was significantly increased at the post-test and marginally increased at the follow-up test when compared to the pre-test. No significant differences in P-SC were found in the control group. Structured equation modeling revealed that in the intervention group, high P-SC at the post-test was related to lower levels of a depressed mood at the post-test and follow-up test. Results demonstrate that this program increases P-SC, which might ameliorate subsequent depressed mood among college students.</p><p id="__p1258">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Junko Kawahito, MD, Graduate School of Education, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, 7390151; j-kawahito@hiroshima-u.ac.jp</p><p id="__p1259">PSW-215</p><p id="__p1260">INTERDISCIPLINARY ETHICS: CASE STUDIES PRESENTED WITHIN THE LEVELS OF PREVENTION MODEL FOR A PILOT NUTRITION PROGRAM AIMED AT INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETES</p><p id="__p1261">Amy Thompson, PhD, Diana Reindl, MA, Elizabeth Greer, undergraduate, Karen Gallagher, MA and Debra Boardley, PhD</p><p id="__p1262">The University of Toledo, Toledo, OH.</p><p id="__p1263">As collaboration between disciplines continues to emerge so do the variety of ethical dilemmas faced. Many vocations have a professional code of ethics to guide acceptable and appropriate behavior however with multiple disciplines collaborating the priority level of the ethical situation may vary. Additionally, depending on the collaborators and the ethical quandaries that arise, diverging viewpoints may develop when determining how to handle the dilemma. This is likely due to the preparation and training of the separate disciplines involved in collaborative efforts. Within the field of Health Education ethical considerations develop in various settings and provide challenging issues to address. Ethical dilemmas originate from the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of the prevention model. This presentation will outline Ignite, a multidisciplinary approach to nutrition education created for intercollegiate students athletes and designed to enhance nutrition knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors of student athletes (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;250). Through collaboration from athletic staff and health educators, Ignite was crafted to address all levels of the prevention model.

A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed randomly to students at four high schools (two girls&#x02019; and two boys&#x02019;), of which 567 (94.5%) were returned and valid for analysis. The questionnaire was designed to collect data on a number of variables about HIV/AIDS epidemic including students&#x02019; general knowledge and attitudes, its mode of transmission and students&#x02019; source of information about the disease. Data were analyzed in a descriptive fashion.</p><p id="__p1271">Results: Despite the majority of high school students correctly identified the main modes of HIV/AIDS transmission, there was a relative deficiency in their knowledge about the disease. Students&#x02019; attitudes were consequently defective towards HIV/AIDS infected people. Their main source of information about the infection was the media, particularly TV. The results indicated that the contribution of schools, health staff and relatives in providing high school students with knowledge about HIV/AIDS was the minimal.</p><p id="__p1272">Conclusion: There is need to provide students with correct information on HIV/AIDS infection.

The objective of this study was the investigation of the work ability of nurses working in hospital wards.</p><p id="__p1279">Methodology: The methodology encompassed the work ability analysis using the Portuguese version of Work Ability Index. Our sample consisted of 238 nurses working in 14 hospital wards of a central hospital. Participants were aged between 22 and 63&#x000a0;years (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;34,24; sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,02), 82,4% were female, 50,4% were single and on average had spent 10&#x000a0;years with the current hospital (min&#x02009;=&#x02009;0,5; max&#x02009;=&#x02009;33; sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;9,5).</p><p id="__p1280">Results: The average results of the work ability index for all nurses were 38,7 (min&#x02009;=&#x02009;18; max&#x02009;=&#x02009;49; sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;5,84) corresponding to a good work ability. The proportion of nurses with &#x000ab;good&#x000bb; work ability was the largest (47,1%), followed by the group with&#x02009;&#x000ab;&#x02009;moderate&#x02009;&#x000bb;&#x02009;work ability (27,3%). The results by age group show a decrease of work ability with age. To test if work ability differences do exist between age groups an one way Anova was used. The results show that significant differences exist in work ability index by age groups (F(238;3) = 19,76; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;,000). The work ability median for the group aged above 45&#x000a0;years was 35,5, belonging to the&#x02009;&#x000ab;&#x02009;moderate&#x02009;&#x000bb;&#x02009;category.</p><p id="__p1281">Discussion: The average work ability index have been found to decrease with age what is in agreement with several studies. Slightly under half of the sample had a good index (47,1%), but there was a substantial prevalence (32,3%) of decreased WAI (poor and moderate categories) what is in concordance with the results of other studies with healthcare workers. These results can be explained by the nature of the work in hospital wards. People working in physically demanding jobs usually have lower average WAI than people working in mentally demanding jobs. Besides this fact, among nursing personnel the decrease of work ability can be accelerated due to several factors present in the workplace, namely the level of dependency of patients, the number of staff, the availability of mechanical lifts, the rooms lay-out, the shift work and others.</p><p id="__p1282">Conclusions: The study results imply the need for programs in the workplace in order to promote wellbeing. Work ability is the foundation of employability and employment which is getting more importance nowadays in order to prevent the discrimination of older nurses at the hospitals. The work ability index is an important tool for bringing together the working capabilities of ageing employees, identifying their needs and sustaining the choices of occupational health services in the development of programs to enable ageing employees to work.</p><p id="__p1283">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Alexandra Pereira, Master, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, 3800; alexandra.pereira@ua.pt</p><p id="__p1284">PSW-218</p><p id="__p1285">THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OLDER WORKERS&#x02019; VITALITY BY USING THE INTERVENTION MAPPING PROTOCOL</p><p id="__p1286">Jorien E.

The sample consisted of 591 Spanish adolescents (40.4% boys and 59.6% girls) with a mean age of 15.75 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;.88). The level of knowledge about HIV transmission was assessed using the HIV-KS scale (Espada et al., 2009), and the attitudes towards HIV/AIDS and risk practices was assessed using the CASIPR scale (Espada et al. 2009). A quasi-experimental design with two experimental conditions was carried out, with an experimental group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;371) and a waiting-list control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;220). Each school was randomly assigned to one of the conditions. The intervention consisted of 5 one-hour sessions that included the following components: information and cognitive restructuring, social skills training, problem solving training and covered behavioral rehearsal. The effects of the interventions was evaluated through a immediate posttest assessment controlling for the baseline differences. The results point to a greater change in knowledge about HIV/AIDS in individuals who are not sexually active (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.86, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01) than those who are (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.81, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01).

This study compared three versions of a web-based game targeting the malaria risk reduction decision-making of study abroad students. This population is in jeopardy due to the rapid expansion of programs in malaria endemic regions and the low level of acquired immunity and malaria knowledge among US citizens. Constructs from the self-regulation model and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning informed the creation and evaluation of this game. A three-condition experimental design was used to compare feedback strategies for game decisions: baseline corrective (right/wrong) feedback and explanatory feedback that is either provided automatically with each decision or only when players click on a link to access it. Primary outcome measures were malaria knowledge and player satisfaction. Study abroad email lists at seven Midwestern campuses were used to recruit participants without incentive. Of the 1428 participants who entered the study protocol and were randomly assigned to condition, 918 (64%) completed the pre-survey, 540 (38%) completed the game, and 482 (34%) completed the post-survey. Only the automatically provided explanatory feedback condition produced a significantly higher knowledge score on the post-test when adjusted for pre-test score. There were no significant differences in player satisfaction between the three feedback conditions, while 65% of participants rated game satisfaction as &#x02018;very&#x02019; to &#x02018;extremely&#x02019; satisfying.

Although it is suggested that psychological factors may play a role in OTC drug misuse, the main factors that might be associated with one&#x02019;s manner of drug intake are unknown. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the illness perceptions and beliefs about taking OTC medicines and to investigate the differences between users and misusers of OTC medicines. Method: The subjects were 108 undergraduate students (age mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.27, S.D.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.67). They retrospectively completed self-report measures addressing (a) illness perceptions, (b) beliefs about taking OTC medicines, (c) how to take OTC medicines, (d) common cold symptoms, and (e) frequency of intake. Result: The analysis of covariance indicated that misuse of OTC medicines was related to an individual&#x02019;s perceptions that concern consequences of illness (F (1, 107) = 5.85; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and controllability (F (1,107) = 6.57, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). However, no other factors are associated with misuse of OTC medicines. Conclusion: This study revealed that consumers&#x02019; perceptions are associated with their manner of drug intake. These findings indicate that the tendency to misuse OTC drugs can be evaluated using a self-report questionnaire of illness perception. Further studies are needed in order to develop brief questions to evaluate and examine if illness perceptions predict one&#x02019;s manner of drug intake.</p><p id="__p1328">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Takanori Honda, BA, Graduate school of Human Sciences, Waseda university, Tokorozawa, Saitama, 359-1192; whs.be_a_cp144@asagi.waseda.jp</p><p id="__p1329">PSW-221d</p><p id="__p1330">DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF A MOURNING-TASK WORKSHOP AFTER DISSOLUTION OF AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP IN COLLEGE STUDENTS</p><p id="__p1331">Judith de la Serna, student</p><p id="__p1332">Psychology, Universidad Nacional Aut&#x000f3;noma de M&#x000e9;xico, Mexico City, Mexico.</p><p id="__p1333">Breakups are usually distressing and generate different consequences (emotional, cognitive, behavioral and physiological) that can be associated to poor social relationships, physical/mental disorders and may eventually lead to suicide.</p><p id="__p1334">The dissolution of a relationship implies a transitional crisis and is considered a relational loss that generates a grieving process.

There is considerable research showing that multiple factors such as patient&#x02019;s characteristics (e.g., age), medication related aspects (e.g., side effects) as well as environmental factors (e.g., availability) do affect adherence. In addition, the self-regulatory theory underlines the importance of subjective perceptions and beliefs guiding individual coping behaviour.</p><p id="__p1365">The symposium addresses the interaction of illness perceptions and of treatment related beliefs with adherence to treatment from various perspectives. First, Nestoriuc et al. (1) present an epidemiologic study showing the relevance of medication beliefs in the general population and the psychometric foundation of the widely used Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ). Next, two studies are presented about the association of illness perceptions and of medication beliefs with non-adherence in clinical samples. Broadbent et al. (2) present evidence on the effect of both on adherence to immunosuppressant medication in liver transplant patients; while the results of Martin et al. (3) suggest that medication beliefs are associated with the intake of anti-hypertensive eye drops in patients with glaucoma, whereas illness perceptions do not additionally explain the degree of adherence.</p><p id="__p1366">As both, the efficacy of a medication and patient adherence to the therapeutic regiment, influence the effectiveness of a treatment, it appears necessary to improve adherence in many illnesses, e. g. by psychological interventions. Petrie et al. (4) suggest a brief and economic intervention - a tailored text message programme - to change patients&#x02019; illness perceptions with the aim to improve treatment adherence. Their controlled trial show promising results in asthma patients.</p><p id="__p1367">Based on the presentations the symposium will offer a discussion about present evidence and perspectives regarding the role of patients&#x02019; beliefs and perceptions on adherence.</p><p id="__p1368">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Alexandra Martin, PhD, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital of Erlangen, Erlangen, 91054; alexandra.martin@uk-erlangen.de</p><p id="__p1369">SS01a</p><p id="__p1370">TARGETED TEXT MESSAGING DESIGNED TO CHANGE PERCEPTIONS IMPROVES ADHERENCE TO ASTHMA PREVENTER MEDICATION</p><p id="__p1371">Keith Petrie, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Kate Perry, PhD,<sup>2</sup> John Weinman, PhD,<sup>3</sup> Hamish Franklin, BS<sup>2</sup> and Jonny Duder, BS<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1372"><sup>1</sup>University of Auckland Medical School, Auckland, New Zealand; <sup>2</sup>Atlantis Health Care, Auckland, New Zealand and <sup>3</sup>Kings College, London, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p1373">Background: While effective preventative medication is readily available in asthma, adherence is a major problem due to patients&#x02019; beliefs about their illness and medication.

One possible explanation is that men and women have different needs in terms of stress reduction. Thus, it appears that family problems constitute stronger emotional stressors and provoke more depressive feelings in women than men, and that women, even when working outside the home are more endangered by family stress than by work stress. Therefore, the Stockholm Women&#x02019;s Intervention Trial (SWITCHD) was specifically designed to meet the needs of women CVD patients in terms of tailored stress reduction. This randomized clinical trial decreased CVD mortality in women receiving the intervention compared to women receiving standard care, providing evidence that an intervention designed to satisfy the gender related needs of women may prolong life in women with CVD.</p><p id="__p1430">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hans-Christian Deter, MD, University Medical Center, Berlin, 12200; deter@charite.de</p><p id="__p1431">SS02d</p><p id="__p1432">BEHAVIORAL AND BIOLOGICAL FACTORS IN PSYCHOSOMATIC/BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE INTERVENTIONS FOR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD)</p><p id="__p1433">Neil Schneiderman, PhD<sup>1</sup> and Kristina Orth-Gom&#x000e9;r, MD<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1434"><sup>1</sup>University of Miami, Miami, FL and <sup>2</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p id="__p1435">Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that have used behavioral interventions designed to reduce morbidity and/or mortality in patients who have had major adverse coronary events (MACE) have reported positive, null and negative Results: In general RCT that have been successful used group based interventions, behavior change strategies, at least 20 sessions during the course of a year, and have followed patients for at least several years. Some successful studies (e.g., Stockholm Women&#x02019;s Intervention Trial for Coronary Heart Disease: SWITCHD) have employed relaxation training, suggesting that stress reduction is important. SWITCHD also found that the interaction between behavioral intervention and the use of statins also appeared to decrease mortality. And in research conducted in animals we have found that social affiliation can attenuate the development of atherosclerosis by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress. Because patients with CAD typically are prescribed multiple medications, medication adherence may be a useful intervention target. Similarly, because most CAD patients are overweight, physically inactive, and may have metabolic syndrome, behavioral intervention strategies to increase weight loss and improve fitness could be useful for addressing these issues. This presentation will compare and contrast RCT in terms of the biological and behavioral bases of the intervention strategies used to treat CAD patients.</p><p id="__p1436">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hans-Christian Deter, MD, University Medical Center, Berlin, 12200; deter@charite.de</p><p id="__p1437">SS03</p><p id="__p1438">EXPLORING THE NATURE, CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF &#x0201c;HIKIKOMORI&#x0201d; (SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL): A RECENT ADVANCES IN EPIDEMIOLOGY AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</p><p id="__p1439">Norito Kawakami, MD</p><p id="__p1440">School of Public Health, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.</p><p id="__p1441">The &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; (social withdrawal) describes a psychopathological and sociological phenomenon in which people, and especially younger generations, become completely withdrawn from society for six months or longer.

But cases of &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; were reported also in Oman and Spain. Recently, a large-scale community-based epidemiology study in Japan, the World Mental Health Japan Survey, as well as other studies, reported that the prevalence, psychiatric comorbidity, and childhood risk factors of &#x0201c;hikikomiri&#x0201d;.

Etiology and epidemiology are poorly understood, and evidence for interventions is lacking. The purpose of this study is to describe onset and maintenance of hikikomori. Direct recruitment, snowballing and participant observation in on-line chat rooms were used to recruit participants and obtain data, which was then subject to grounded theory analysis. Of 168 participants several were unconnected with Japan, the oldest being 60&#x000a0;years old. Three major themes emerged of hikikomori as passive coping, trust and existence. Each theme comprised one or more categories, which in turn evidenced a number of different elements. Definitive characteristics of hikikomori were obtained from respondents through virtual participant observation. The emergent theoretical framework and the list are mutually supportive in the results obtained from this study, which suggested emotional pain exists in hikikomori in relation to human relationships. The results of the present study suggest that hikikomori is characterized by more diffuse features, including difficulties in coping with people or tasks, difficulties with trust, unhappiness about life and poor concept of time. There was no evidence of violent or aggressive behaviours.We conclude that Hikikomori is not unique to Japanese youth, but more widespread and diverse anomic coping style for dealing with social disaffection seen cross-culturally.</p><p id="__p1448">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Roseline Yong, MPH, Tokyo University, Tokyo, 113-0033; yangjinhong@gmail.com</p><p id="__p1449">SS03b</p><p id="__p1450">PREVALENCE AND PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY OF &#x0201c;HIKIKOMORI&#x0201d; IN A COMMUNITY POPULATION IN JAPAN</p><p id="__p1451">Asuka Koyama, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Norito Kawakami, MD<sup>1</sup> and World Mental Heath Japan Survey Group, None<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1452"><sup>1</sup>School of Public Health, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan and <sup>2</sup>National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Kodaira, Japan.</p><p id="__p1453">Aims: Epidemiology of &#x0201c;hikikomori (acute social withdrawal)&#x0201d; in a community population is not clear, although it has been noted for the decade in Japan.

A total of 78% of the &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; cases in our study reported that they had felt worried or irritable about their &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; situation. Most of the &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; cases did not feel the desire to go to work or attend school even if they still had such a duty. There was no case in this study who reported violent behaviors during &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d;. Respondents who experienced &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; had 6.1 times higher the risk of mood disorder.

This study examines childhood adversities and family environments as childhood risk factors for &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; using the retrospective data derived from a population-based survey, the World Mental Health Japan. A random sample of residents aged 20 or older in nine communities in Japan was used, and interviews were conducted using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,134, response rate&#x02009;=&#x02009;51%). The subjects of this study were a subsample who responded to the second part of the interview (Part 2), and were aged between 20-49&#x000a0;years (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;708). Multiple logistic regression was used to explore the association between the lifetime experience of &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; and childhood risk factors; social class, parental psychopathology, parents&#x02019; child rearing style, and other adverse events during a respondent&#x02019;s childhood. The statistical model was adjusted for sex, age, and respondents&#x02019; experience of common mental disorders using a sampling weight for Part 2. Among the 708 respondents, 15 experienced &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; in their lifetime (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.7 or 1.2% in a weighted analysis). Father&#x02019;s high educational level (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.0, CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.6&#x02013;22.9), mother&#x02019;s common mental disorders (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.5, CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1-38.0), and mother&#x02019;s panic disorders (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.6, CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1&#x02013;39.1) were significantly and positively associated with the experience of &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; after controlling for respondents&#x02019; sex, age, and history of mental disorders. Significant associations were not found for parents&#x02019; child rearing styles or childhood adversities. Our findings suggest that &#x0201c;hikikomori&#x0201d; cases are more likely to occur in families where the parents have high levels of education.

Furthermore, recent studies have found that a substantial portion of the hikikomori population reports symptoms of mental illness (Kawakami, forthcoming). Taking a cultural anthropological approach, this paper explores the social context that allows withdrawing from society to be a prevalent and viable coping mechanism in Japan. The paper draws on ethnographic, participant-observation data from three clinical facilities in the Tokyo area which treat hikikomori populations, and four special education programs which treat children who missed school for long periods due to learning disabilities and social maladjustment. The paper concludes by reviewing recent literature on mental health in Japan in order to hypothesize about whether Japanese psychiatry will move away from relying so heavily on families and towards psycho-pharmacological treatments as the dominant method and perceived "cure" for addressing psychopathology.</p><p id="__p1469">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Amy Borovoy, Phd, East Asian Studies, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08544-1008; aborovoy@princeton.edu</p><p id="__p1470">\n<strong>Thursday</strong>\n</p><p id="__p1471">\n<strong>August 5, 2010</strong>\n</p><p id="__p1472">\n<strong>PAPER SESSIONS</strong>\n</p><p id="__p1473">\n<strong>8:30&#x000a0;AM-10:00&#x000a0;AM</strong>\n</p><p id="__p1474">OS01</p><p id="__p1475">8:30&#x000a0;AM-8:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1476">OS01-A</p><p id="__p1477">THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIOECONOMIC HEALTH DIFFERENCES IN CHILDHOOD: RESULTS OF THE DUTCH LONGITUDINAL PIAMA BIRTH COHORT</p><p id="__p1478">Annemarie Ruijsbroek, Msc,<sup>1</sup> Alet Wijga, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Marjan Kerkhof, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Gerard H.

Social integration is suggested to protect adults from ill health; this study examines whether the protective effect of social integration is seen longitudinally and is present in the case of the co-occurrence of depression and central obesity.</p><p id="__p1501">We used 3 sweeps of a prospective cohort study, the National Child Development Study, when the participants were aged 33, 42, and 45 (Men&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,043, Women&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,153). Co-occurrence of depression and central obesity was assessed at age 45, by the presence or absence of depression (scores over 2 on the depression subscale of the Clinical Interview Schedule) and central obesity (a waist to hip ratio greater or equal to 0.9 for men, 0.85 for women). Social integration was assessed at age 42 using information about cohabitation, employment status, and frequency of attendance at religious or socially organised groups. Psychological health, longstanding illness, and social position assessed at age 33 are treated as confounders and men and women were analysed separately.</p><p id="__p1502">Findings using multinomial logistic regression showed the significance of employment as the key protective element of social integration among middle aged adults. Working full time at age 42 was less likely to be associated with depression at age 45 even along with central obesity, but not with central obesity alone. This effect was independent of the effects from the confounders and greater among men (Depression: OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07&#x02013;0.32; Comorbdity: OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25, 95%CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.14&#x02013;0.45). Although considered a confounder rather than an explanatory variable, it is worth noting that psychological ill health at age 33 was linked to depression at age 45 in men and women; however, the degree of the association is greater when central obesity is present, confirming the complex mechanism of co-occurrence of depression and central obesity. It appears employment, may protect middle aged adults against comorbid depression and central obesity through its relationship with depression.</p><p id="__p1503">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Noriko Cable, PhD, Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT; n.cable@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="__p1504">9:24&#x000a0;AM-9:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1505">OS01-D</p><p id="__p1506">THE HOPE PROJECTS: ADDRESSING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AMONG LOW INCOME, ETHNICALLY DIVERSE WOMEN IN RURAL NORTH CAROLINA</p><p id="__p1507">Salli Benedict, MPH,<sup>1</sup> Marci K.

The Community-based participatory research process led us to develop interventions to address women&#x02019;s health within the context of the economic and social circumstances of their lives: poverty, unemployment, racism and lack of access to resources. HOPE (Health, Opportunities, Partnerships, Empowerment) Works (2004&#x02013;2009) was a successful obesity prevention intervention that drew upon development strategies including loan circles, microenterprise development, and American Indian talking circles. Community women were trained to organize and facilitate HOPE Circles of 8&#x02013;12 women from their social networks. Circles met twice a month for 6&#x000a0;months: women set goals and supported each other to make health and social/economic improvements.

Seeds of HOPE (2009&#x02013;2014) will disseminate the HOPE Works model through American Indian and African American churches and community health clinics. It will have a stronger emphasis on microenterprise development and financial literacy. HOPE Accounts for Women (2009&#x02013;2011) is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act through the National Institutes of Health. This innovative program uses the HOPE Works model but enhances the economic empowerment/financial literacy training by assisting low income women in saving money for starting a business or furthering education through a matched savings incentive. Data from the first 3 cohorts (159 Intervention, 118 Comparison) in the HOPE Works study show that 75% of women were African American and most were low income: outcome analysis demonstrated that HOPE Circle participants lowered BMI more than the comparison group with average weight loss difference of 4 pounds.

Because there is limited evidence within any one disease, such reviews do not provide strong evidence for peer support. In contrast, a more general review of peer support across a range of health behaviors can lead to more solid conclusions about its effectiveness. We conducted a systematic review of research on peer support for complex health behavior (e.g., cardiovascular risk reduction) across a variety of health problems. An initial PubMed search of papers published between 1/1/2001 and 8/31/2009 and using cognates of &#x0201c;coach,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;promotora,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;peer support,&#x0201d; etc. identified 902 peer-reviewed articles. Of these, 595 articles were excluded as their titles indicated that they were not patient behavior programs (e.g. coaching for career growth among health professionals). The remaining 307 were reviewed to fit a broad definition of peer support: provided by a nonprofessional and addressing support for multiple health behaviors over time. Exclusion criteria consisted of: Interventions focused on isolated or single behaviors (e.g. cancer screening); interventions evaluating educational classes; and those without outcome data. The resulting 40 papers addressed: breastfeeding (6 papers); diabetes (5 papers), depression (5 papers), and asthma (4 papers), along with a variety of other health issues, and represented 8 different countries. Provisional rating of outcomes was: No evidence of benefit; Modest evidence of benefit (e.g., changes on self report measure of health behaviors or quality of life); and Strong evidence of benefit (e.g. statistically significant changes on objective clinical measure such as blood pressure or blood glucose, or on well validated psychological measure such as the CES-D). Of the 40 papers, 7 were scored as No, 15 as Modest, and 18 as Strong Evidence of Benefit. Further evaluation of effect sizes and weighting by sample sizes and adequacy of controls will be included in presentation at the Congress. This systematic review indicates that peer support is effective in promoting complex health behaviors across a variety of diseases and national settings.</p><p id="__p1547">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Emily A.

Poverty, illiteracy, poor public health system are tremendously impacting on majority of people&#x02019;s lives who are living in rural areas and limited access to primary health care services. The government of Nepal declared the free health care policy from early 2008 with a view to improve access to and utilization of health services for people who are poor, socially disadvantaged and marginalized communities. The new health policy has highlighted the needs to expand health services in rural areas where there is acute lack of human resources, irregular supplies of drugs and equipment and poor health infrastructure. The pro-poor health policy aims to narrow the wider gaps of disparities in health care by ensuring health equity and the rights of people to their health and life.</p><p id="__p1554">Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the effects of pro-poor health care policy at the community levels.</p><p id="__p1555">Methods: It was a cross-sectional study with primary focus on qualitative research methodology. The methods for data collection were focus group discussion and in-depth interviews with service providers in local health facilities, community groups, key informants and the beneficiaries.

There is 15 to 20 % increment in health facility utilization by poor, socially disadvantaged and marginalized communities. There is significant level of community awareness of free health care policy and provision. The supplies of drugs and other logistics at health facilities are gradually improved in the rural areas where as human resources for health are still lacking and not adequate compared to the health care needs of the people. The pro-poor health policy has been instrumental in accessing and utilizing the services by the poorest of the poor as it is free of charge and available in local health facilities.</p><p id="__p1557">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jhabindra Bhandari, MPH, Health Research, SUCHDEF Nepal, Kathmandu, 977-1; jh_bhandari@yahoo.com</p><p id="__p1558">OS03</p><p id="__p1559">8:30&#x000a0;AM-8:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1560">OS03-A</p><p id="__p1561">SOCIAL SUPPORT BUFFERS SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY TO ACUTE PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS</p><p id="__p1562">Roberto La Marca, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Pearl Ghaemmaghami, MSc,<sup>1</sup> M&#x000e9;lanie Tripod, MSc,<sup>1</sup> Hanna Th&#x000f6;rn, MSc,<sup>1</sup> Patricia Waldvogel, BSc,<sup>1</sup> Jens C.

One possible mechanism is that social support has a buffering effect on the sympathetic stress response. The salivary enzyme alpha-amylase (sAA), reflecting the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), seems to be a promising indicator for stress research. The main purpose of the present study was to test the effect of perceived social support (PSS) on acute sAA stress reactivity.</p><p id="__p1565">Thirty-three healthy, young male subjects participated in a computerized stress task consisting of arithmetic problems that had to be solved under time-pressure and social evaluation.

Furthermore, higher levels of PSS were negatively associated with ratings of chronic stress (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.384, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and habitual stress reactivity (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.372, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05).</p><p id="__p1567">This is the first study examining the relationship between PSS and acute sAA stress reactivity.

However, the exact mechanisms through which music exerts its positive consequences on the body are poorly understood. It was the aim of the current study to address this gap in knowledge and to examine the underlying mechanisms of music effects across neuroendocrine, autonomous, cognitive, and emotional domains of the human stress response. Sixty healthy female volunteers (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;25.27&#x000a0;years) were exposed to a standardized psychosocial stress test after having been randomly assigned to one of three different conditions prior to the stressor: 1) relaxing music (&#x02018;Miserere&#x02019;, Allegri) (RM), 2) sound of rippling water (SW) and 3) rest without acoustic stimulation (R). Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA), anticipatory cognitive appraisal, subjective stress perception and anxiety were repeatedly assessed in all subjects. We hypothesized that listening to music prior to the stressor, compared to SW or R would result in an attenuated stress reaction. The stressor caused significant changes in all measurements in all three groups over time. The three conditions significantly differed regarding cortisol responses (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014), with highest values in the RM and lowest values in SW. sAA recovery delta showed a statistical trend (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.060) in favor of the RM. Psychological measures did not significantly differ between groups during the experiment. Our findings indicate that music listening differentially impacts the psychobiological stress system. Listening to music prior to a psychological stressor increases rather than attenuates subsequent endocrine stress responses. In contrast, listening to water sound seems to result in an attenuated endocrine response to stress compared to no auditory stimulation. Listening to music seems to increase autonomic recovery more efficiently than listening to water sound or resting in silence. These findings bear potential to explain the effects of music on the human body.</p><p id="__p1575">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Myriam V.

This was tested on 19 healthy workers on a Norwegian oil rig in the North Sea. They worked two weeks offshore followed by 4&#x000a0;weeks off work. The ordinary schedule was to work 12-hour day shift during one work period (14&#x000a0;days), and 12-hour night shift on the next work period (14 nights)(fixed-shift). &#x0201c;Swing shift&#x0201d; involves night shift during the first week, then day shift the second week, for every working period. The advantage of swing shift is that the workers are readapted to a normal day-night rhythm when they start their 4&#x000a0;week off work period. The disadvantage is that the workers have to adjust their biological rhythms twice every work period instead of once every other work period. All participants worked ordinary night-day shift when baseline data were collected (questionnaires, saliva cortisol, and reaction time during work). After collection of baseline data the workers changed their work schedule to &#x0201c;swing shift&#x0201d;, one year later the same data were collected. &#x0201c;Swing shift&#x0201d; did not give any negative health effects or any negative changes in reaction time during the day they shifted from night work to day work. During swing shift the cortisol rhythm went slowly back to a normal rhythm in the second week, but it was not fully returned to normal values when they returned home for the 4&#x000a0;weeks off period. When working swing shift the cortisol rhythms were readapted to normal values after one week at home. For personnel returning home directly from 14 consecutive night shifts, diurnal cortisol adaptation was not complete after one week at home.</p><p id="__p1582">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anette Harris, MSc, Faculty of psychology, University of Bergen, Bergen, 5020; anette.harris@uib.no</p><p id="__p1583">9:24&#x000a0;AM-9:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1584">OS03-D</p><p id="__p1585">RELATION BETWEEN VAGAL FUNCTION AND CORTISOL STRESS RESPONSE</p><p id="__p1586">Roberto La Marca, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Patricia Waldvogel, BSc,<sup>1</sup> Hanna Th&#x000f6;rn, MSc,<sup>1</sup> M&#x000e9;lanie Tripod, MSc,<sup>1</sup> Jens C.

As diabetic foot ulcers are characterized by chronic inflammation, it is plausible that emotional distress could delay the healing of such ulcers by up-regulating and sustaining high ulcer tissue-specific levels of IL-6. Here we report a cross-sectional study of 41 patients with type 2 DM (76% male; mean age 55&#x000a0;yrs) and plantar neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (University of Texas Classification: 82% grade 1A; 12% 1B; 3% 2A; and 3% 2B). The relationship between patient self reported generalized emotional distress, foot ulcer-specific emotional responses and ulcer biopsy IL-6 levels was investigated. Generalized emotional distress was assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS: 1.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8) and with two Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales: HADS-Anxiety (13.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.4) and HADS-Depression (11.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.0). Foot ulcer-specific emotional responses were assessed with three subscales: Patient Interpretation of Neuropathy (PIN)-Amputation Worry (4.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8), PIN-Anger at Practitioners (2.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.0) and Neuropathy and Foot Ulcer-Specific Quality of Life (NeuroQoL)-Interpersonal Burden (3.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2). Ulcer-specific IL-6 levels were determined via quantification of immunohistochemical wound biopsy tissue localization. Additionally, assessed was the physiologic marker of emotional distress, 9&#x000a0;am and 12noon serum cortisol (458.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;125.8&#x000a0;nmol/l and 625&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;369.7&#x000a0;nmol/l, respectively). In the bivariate analysis, more severe generalized and foot-ulcer-specific emotional distress were each associated with higher levels of ulcer biopsy log-transformed IL-6 (raw mean: 608.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;545.5 cells/mm2): HADS-Anxiety (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.44; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.031), PSS (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.44; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034), PIN-Amputation Worry (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.54; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007) and NeuroQoL-Interpersonal Burden (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.60; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004). No significant relationship was noted between serum cortisol and IL-6. These preliminary findings identify a strong link between subjective measures of emotional distress and wound specific IL-6 up-regulation.

Such conditions are complicated and draining to live with, and successful adaptation may depend on ability to self-regulate. Self-regulation involves capacity to exercise control and guide or alter reactions and behavior. Research indicates that self-regulatory strength is a limited source that can be depleted or fatigued, however, and patients with FMS and TMD may, when trying to adapt to the many demands of their illnesses, deplete or fatigue their self-regulatory resources. The current study aimed to show that patients with FMS and TMD, compared with healthy controls, are more vulnerable to self-regulatory fatigue as a consequence of their condition, and that self-regulatory fatigue has specific physiological markers. Research has found self-regulatory effort to lead to self-regulatory fatigue, indicated by less capacity to persist on a subsequent task. Patients (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) and matched controls (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) were exposed to an experimental self-regulation task, followed by a persistence task. Controls in the low self-regulation condition displayed continued high persistence as expected. However, patients in the same condition displayed similar persistence as patients and controls in the high self-regulatory condition, indicating that patients with FMS and TMD may in fact be suffering from chronic self-regulatory fatigue. Baseline heart rate variability, heart rate, blood glucose, and cortisol predicted persistence, more so for controls than for patients, and more so in the low versus high self-regulation condition. Impact of illness on self-regulatory effort was mediated by pain, but not by any other factors. The current study shows that patients with chronic multi-symptom illnesses likely suffer from chronic self-regulatory fatigue, and that self-regulatory capacity needs to be taken into account when aiming to treat and help these patients through behavioral interventions.</p><p id="__p1607">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lise Solberg Nes, PhD, Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905; solbergnes.lise@mayo.edu</p><p id="__p1608">8:48&#x000a0;AM-9:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1609">OS04-B</p><p id="__p1610">IS APPRECIATION OF WRITTEN EDUCATION RELATED TO CHANGES IN ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH FIBROMYALGIA?</p><p id="__p1611">Miriam van Ittersum, MSc,<sup>1,2</sup> Paul van Wilgen, Dr,<sup>2,3</sup> Johan Groothoff, Prof Dr<sup>2</sup> and Cees van der Schans, Dr<sup>1,2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1612"><sup>1</sup>Research and Innovation Group in Health Care and Nursing, Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; <sup>2</sup>Department of Health Sciences, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands and <sup>3</sup>University Centre for Sport, Exercise and Health, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.</p><p id="__p1613">Objective: To investigate the appreciation of written education about pain neurophysiology in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and its effects on illness perceptions and quality of life.</p><p id="__p1614">Method: A booklet explaining pain neurophysiology (i.e. central sensitisation) was sent to participants with FM.

Nearly &#x000bc; of the UK population are obese, and by 2050 this is predicted to reach 60%. This has enormous cost implications for the NHS. Consequently, tackling obesity is a Government priority. An evidence-base exists of theoretically-informed behaviour change techniques for weight loss, however, in routine practice, doctors more commonly use theoretically-unfounded communication strategies (e.g. information giving). It is not known if the current focus on communication skills teaching during undergraduate training adequately prepares future doctors for this growing challenge.</p><p id="__p1656">Objectives: To examine 1) what behaviour change techniques medical trainees use to facilitate behaviour change in obese patients and 2) how this impacts on patient behavioural intentions.</p><p id="__p1657">Methods: Forty-eight students in their clinical years of a UK medical school were recruited to perform two simulated consultations each. Both consultations involved an obese patient where weight loss was indicated. Simulated patients (SPs) were used to standardise patient variables (e.g. barriers to behaviour change) and presentation of scenario order was counterbalanced. Following each consultation, students assessed the techniques they perceived themselves to have used. SPs rated the extent to which they intended to make behavioural changes. Anonymised transcripts of the audiotaped consultations were coded by independent assessors, blind to student and SP ratings, using a validated behaviour change taxonomy (Abraham &#x00026; Michie, 2008).</p><p id="__p1658">Results: Students reported using a wide range of evidence-based techniques. In contrast, codings of observed communication behaviours were more limited, focusing on information-giving strategies.

Helping patients to adopt healthier behaviors therefore is an important component of medical management and disease prevention. Communication training is a core feature of medical and nursing training. However, recent research reveals that communication training inadequately equips new health professionals for this growing clinical challenge and practitioners remain unconfident about how to discuss behavior change usefully with patients. The study aims to explore how doctors and nurses manage behavior change and identify what barriers operate to prevent effective behavior change management. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 14 medical and 14 nursing practitioners at a range of stages during their training (undergraduate and postgraduate). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using principles of constant comparison to categorise emergent and recurring themes within and between transcripts. Thematic categories arising in initial interviews were explored subsequently and disconfirmatory evidence was sought until thematic saturation arose. Findings reveal that trainees and practitioners consider behavior change to be a fundamental part of medical practice, yet one they are not formally trained in. Participants had developed a range of strategies to encourage behavior change through experiential learning, but were unconvinced of their efficacy. Further barriers to implementing behavior change included the uncertainty over whose responsibility it is, the influence of patient authority within consultations, and desire to protect the doctor-patient relationship. Evidently current communication training is inadequate to equip health practitioners to motivate behavior change. Barriers arise from clinician-patient interactions as well as the context of health care services and have important implications for medical education.</p><p id="__p1667">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sarah Peters, PhD, Psychology, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL; sarah.peters@manchester.ac.uk</p><p id="__p1668">8:48&#x000a0;AM-9:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1669">OS05-D</p><p id="__p1670">IMPLEMENTING A LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION TOOL INTO PRIMARY HEALTH CARE: IDENTIFICATION OF KEY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ADOPTION</p><p id="__p1671">Siw Carlfjord, Doctoral Student,<sup>1</sup> Agneta Andersson, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Preben Bendtsen, Professor,<sup>1</sup> Per Nilsen, Associate Professor<sup>1</sup> and Malou Lindberg, PhD<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1672"><sup>1</sup>Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Link&#x000f6;ping University, Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden and <sup>2</sup>R&#x00026;D Department of Local Health Care, County Council of &#x000d6;sterg&#x000f6;tland, Link&#x000f6;ping University, Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden.</p><p id="__p1673">Background: Lifestyle-related diseases are increasing worldwide, and it is important to address lifestyle issues in primary health care. In order to facilitate this, a tool for lifestyle intervention was developed and implemented in primary health care in Sweden.

A qualitative study where staff at the units participated in focus group interviews was performed. Interviews were analyzed using the method qualitative content analysis.</p><p id="__p1676">Results: A positive organizational climate combined with an explicit implementation strategy did predict a positive implementation outcome when a lifestyle intervention tool was introduced in PHC. Adoption was positively influenced by positive expectations among staff, perceptions of the tool being compatible with existing routines and perceived advantages of the new tool. Organizational changes and staff shortage coinciding with implementation seemed to be obstacles for the adoption process.</p><p id="__p1677">Conclusion: Organizational climate and staff expectations should be assessed in advance when a new tool is to be introduced in PHC.

Given that uptake is less than optimal, despite the availability of no cost vaccination, there is a need to identify psychosocial factors associated with this preventive behaviour. Applying the Common Sense Model, we first identified the illness representations associated with the acceptance and non-acceptance of the cervical cancer vaccine among young Australian women aged 18&#x02013;26. We then assessed whether information regarding the link between the viral causes of cervical cancer and the effect of the preventive vaccine can function as a facilitator of future vaccination behaviours. Participants (N=132) initially completed measures of vaccination status, intentions to be vaccinated, illness representations, perceived risk, perceived vaccine effectiveness and cervical cancer knowledge. Then we experimentally manipulated illness coherence relating to links between the Human Papillomavirus, cervical cancer and the vaccine, by randomly assigning participants to receive either a brief or detailed information condition, to ascertain the effect of this manipulation on vaccination intentions for non-vaccinated women. Higher levels of illness coherence, identity, and perceived vaccine effectiveness, having had a Pap smear in the past, and lower beliefs in the treatment cure/controllability of cervical cancer were associated with vaccination uptake. Higher intentions to be vaccinated among non-vaccinated women were associated with higher levels of illness coherence and perceived risk for cervical cancer. Post-manipulation measures indicated that the detailed condition of the experimental manipulation resulted in significant increases in illness coherence. The identification of illness cognitions and the role of illness coherence influencing the acceptance of this vaccine adds to the paucity of information available on this underrepresented sample and provides direction for the design of future intervention strategies aimed at modifying illness cognitions to increase vaccine uptake.</p><p id="__p1685">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Kerry A.

The purpose of the present study was to identify the kinds of health messages and the kinds of foods likely to be most acceptable to consumers. Data were obtained by means of a nationwide postal survey (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;849). Ratings of the importance of various RS health and functional claims and receptiveness to different foods as RS delivery vehicles were analysed according to the respondents&#x02019; level of fibre engagement, as classified under the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) of Health Behaviour (Weinstein &#x00026; Sandman, 1992). Significant gender differences were found, with women found to be more fibre engaged and also more receptive than men to RS and its potential benefits. The pattern of association between fibre engagement and self-perceived risk of serious health conditions was consistent with previous observations of changes in risk perception at different PAPM stages. Participants&#x02019; ratings revealed a general preference for healthy staples over indulgences as foods for the delivery of RS, with the margin in preference increasing markedly with increased dietary fibre engagement. This application of the PAPM illustrates its potential usefulness as a segmentation tool for the exploitation of community engagement with a relatively familiar health concept or behaviour in the promotion of a novel, related concept or behaviour.</p><p id="__p1693">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Philip Mohr, PhD, CSIRO, Adelaide, SA, 5000; phil.mohr@csiro.au</p><p id="__p1694">8:48&#x000a0;AM-9:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1695">OS06-B</p><p id="__p1696">MULTIPLE BEHAVIOR CHANGE IN DIET AND ACTIVITY: THE MAKE BETTER CHOICES (MBC) TRIAL</p><p id="__p1697">Bonnie Spring, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Kristin Schneider, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Donald Hedeker, PhD,<sup>3</sup> H.

Intervening on more than one risk behavior simultaneously could be efficient, but the optimal goal framing remains unknown. MBC was designed to test which combination of two behaviors (one dietary, one activity) and two goal frames (increase healthy, decrease unhealthy) maximizes healthy behavior change across all four risk behaviors. N = 200 participants with all four risk behaviors [high saturated fat intake (Fat), low fruit and vegetable intake (FV), low physical activity (PA), high sedentary leisure screen time (Sed)] were randomized to one of four goal prescriptions: &#x02191;FV&#x02191;PA; &#x02193;Fat&#x02191;PA; &#x02191;FV&#x02193;Sed; &#x02193;Fat&#x02193;Sed. They used handheld technology and coaching to change one diet and one activity behavior simultaneously, while change in untargeted (collateral) behavior was also measured. The Familiarity hypothesis predicted best outcome from usual dieting behaviors (&#x02193;Fat&#x02191;PA). The Optimal Substitution hypothesis, based on behavioral economic theory, predicted best outcome from substituting healthful for unhealthful behaviors (&#x02191;FV&#x02193;SED). The Low Inhibitory Demand hypothesis, based on Baumeister&#x02019;s self-regulatory strength model, predicted best outcome from minimizing demand on self-control resources (&#x02191;FV&#x02191;PA). To scale all behaviors to a common metric, the primary outcome was healthy lifestyle change expressed as a z score reflecting improvement relative to the sample baseline for each behavior and averaged to yield a composite score. As predicted by behavioral economic theory, mixed linear models showed that &#x02191;FV&#x02193;Sed maximized healthy lifestyle change compared to alternative interventions [t(345) = 3.3, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001], producing a sustained 1&#x000a0;s.d. improvement in saturated fat intake as well as in both targeted behaviors. The untargeted decrease in saturated fat intake complemented the targeted reduction in recreational screen time (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.29, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04). Paralleling observed behavior changes, &#x02191;FV&#x02193;Sed improved self-efficacy for changing FV (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), Sed (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), and, marginally, Fat (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.09). Conversely, the traditional dieting regimen (&#x02193;Fat&#x02191;PA) produced less healthy lifestyle change than alternative prescriptions [t (345) = &#x02212; 2.09, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04], yielding sustained 1&#x000a0;s.d. improvement only in saturated fat. Relatedly, &#x02193;Fat&#x02191;PA failed to increase self-efficacy for targeted behaviors and decreased efficacy for FV and Sed (both p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Increasing healthy low-rate eating behavior and decreasing unhealthy high-rate physical activity produced greater and unexpectedly sustained healthy lifestyle change than alternative prescriptions.</p><p id="__p1700">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Bonnie Spring, PhD, Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60610; bspring@northwestern.edu</p><p id="__p1701">9:06&#x000a0;AM-9:24&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1702">OS06-C</p><p id="__p1703">MY HEALTH MATTERS: A COMMUNITY-LED INTERVENTION TO REDUCE HEALTH INEQUALITIES RELATED TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY &#x00026; HEALTHY EATING IN STOKE-ON-TRENT, UK</p><p id="__p1704">Gemma Hurst, PhD Behaviour Change - Physical Activity,<sup>1</sup> Rachel Davey, PhD<sup>1</sup> and Graham Smith, MSc<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1705"><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Health, Staffordshire University, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom and <sup>2</sup>Institute for Environment, Sustainability &#x00026; Regeneration, Staffordshire University, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p1706">Background: Research has demonstrated a strong link between the built environment, health outcomes &#x00026; inequalities.

Results: GIS mapping illustrated a lack of local access to fresh food outlets but easy access to fast food outlets. 76-96% of residents were within 300&#x000a0;m walking distance of green space, but these spaces were of poor quality e.g. not functional. Physical activity facilities were within walking distance for some neighbourhoods but not for others. The community survey demonstrated that self-reported health was lower than average compared to England. Negative perceived characteristics of the neighbourhood included; aesthetics (e.g. lack of trees), traffic hazards &#x00026; crime. Most people surveyed enjoyed living in their area &#x00026; on average had lived there for over 20&#x000a0;years. However, there was low perception of trust &#x00026; problems with teenagers &#x00026; vandalism. 70-80% of the sample were not eating the recommended portions of fruit &#x00026; vegetables per day &#x00026; 70% were sedentary i.e. not reaching 30 minutes of moderate physical activity 5&#x000a0;days per week. Conclusion: In general, the environments of all three areas were not supportive of healthy living, did not facilitate physical activity or help to promote healthy eating. Recommendations for community consultation &#x00026; action (phase II) &#x00026; directions for policy change will be discussed.</p><p id="__p1707">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Gemma L.

The objective of our meta-analytic review is to critically examine the effectiveness of workplace physical activity and dietary behavior interventions on weight outcomes. Six databases were searched for English-written studies published between 1980 and November 2009. Two authors independently selected 43 studies which met inclusion criteria. Data could be extracted from 22 studies for meta-analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using a predefined checklist. The GRADE approach was used to determine the level of evidence for each pooled outcome measure. Results show there is moderate quality of evidence that workplace physical activity and dietary behavior interventions have a significant positive effect on body weight (14 studies; Mean Difference (MD) &#x02212;1.17&#x000a0;kg [95% Confidence interval (CI) &#x02212;1.54 to &#x02212;0.80]). There is low quality of evidence for a significant positive effect on body mass index (14 studies; MD &#x02212;0.3&#x000a0;kg/m2 [95% CI &#x02212;.45 to &#x02212;0.15]) and on percentage body fat (7 studies; MD &#x02212;0.86 % [95% CI &#x02212;1.52 to &#x02212;0.2]). No effects were found for waist circumference (4 studies; MD &#x02212;0.67&#x000a0;cm [95% CI &#x02212;1.96 to 0.63]), waist-hip ratio (4 studies; MD 0&#x000a0;cm[95% CI &#x02212;0.03 to 0.03]), and sum of skinfolds (2 studies; MD &#x02212;0.01&#x000a0;mm [95% CI &#x02212;0.04 to 0.02]). Subgroup analyses showed interventions using an environmental component had a greater reduction in body weight (3 studies; MD &#x02212;1.50&#x000a0;kg [95% CI &#x02212;1.82 to &#x02212;1.17]). Preventing weight gain by improving physical activity and dietary behavior among workers is recommended as the clinical relevance of the pooled effects are substantial on a population level.</p><p id="__p1714">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lisanne M.

However, such theories often do not differentiate between cognitive and affective risk perceptions (or the way in which they interact), and it is generally assumed that any increased risk perceptions of either type are associated with preventive behaviors. The present study aims to differentiate between cognitive (perceived risk) and affective (worry) risk perceptions and explore their direct and interactive relationships with two health-related behaviors. Methods: Combined data from the 2003 and 2007 Health Information National Trends Surveys were analyzed using logistic regression with perceived cancer risk, cancer worry, and their interaction independently predicting two dichotomous variables: a) fulfilling the 5-a-day fruit /vegetable consumption guidelines (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7966) and b) engaging in any exercise in the past month (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8069). Results: Neither perceived risk nor worry was significantly related to fruit/ vegetable consumption. However, their interaction was significant such that those who had both the highest perceived risk and worry were the least likely to fulfill the guidelines (OR: .77, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). With respect to exercise, worry (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.77, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), but not perceived risk, was associated with exercise. More importantly, the interaction was again significant, such that those high in both perceived risk and worry were the least likely to report exercise (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;.77, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01). Conclusion: Counter-intuitively, reporting both high perceived risk and high worry is associated with less exercise and produce consumption. This research may have important implications for interventions, which often do not differentiate between targeting cognitive and affective risk perceptions and may even strive to heighten both types of risk perceptions in efforts to prompt behavior change. In addition, this research may inform communication of risk information; optimal changes in health behaviors may be achieved when cognitive risk perceptions are lower, and affective risk perceptions are higher.</p><p id="__p1721">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Rebecca A.

Three separate randomized clinical trials using group based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) however, have recently observed positive changes in disease endpoints in patients who had experienced breast cancer or adverse coronary disease events. Group CBT included 20-26 two hour sessions over one year. The trials all used strategies to reduce stress, improve mood, alter health behaviors and maintain adherence to medical treatment. These three studies all included women, used intent-to-treat analyses and adjusted for relevant covariates. Andersen and colleagues randomized 227 women who had been surgically treated for regional breast cancer and found after a median of 11&#x000a0;years follow-up, a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;.55, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.034), breast cancer mortality (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;.44; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.016) and all-cause-mortality (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;.51; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.028).

Patients (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;227) surgically treated for regional breast cancer participated. Before beginning adjuvant cancer therapies, patients were assessed with psychological and behavioral measures, had a health evaluation, and a 60&#x000a0;mL blood sample was drawn. Patients were randomized to Psychological Intervention or Assessment only arms. The intervention was psychologist led, conducted in small groups, and included strategies to reduce stress, improve mood, alter health behaviors, and maintain adherence to cancer treatment. Earlier papers (2004, 2007) showed that, compared to the Assessment arm, the Intervention arm improved across all of the latter secondary outcomes. T cell blastogenesis was also enhanced. An interim paper (2007) clarified treatment mechanisms in the Intervention arm. First, patients were satisfied with the intervention, but it was group cohesion that related to better outcomes. Second, offering patients a stress conceptualization (Selye) and teaching them multiple coping strategies related to better health. Third, three relationships between treatment utilization and outcomes are noted: 1) Relaxation training was associated with both distress reduction and symptom lowering. 2) Patients&#x02019; use of assertive communication with health care providers was associated with better health outcomes. 3) Intervention strategy use was also associated with fewer signs/symptoms and cancer treatment toxicities. After a median of 11&#x000a0;years follow-up, recurrence occurred for 62 of 212 (29%) women and death for 54 of 227 (24%). Intent to treat hazard analyses showed, as predicted, Intervention arm patients had a reduced risk of recurrence [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.55, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.034] and breast cancer death (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.44, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.016).

Median attendance rate to the intervention program was 85%. Risk factor and quality of life data were measured at baseline and after 6, 12, 18, 24&#x000a0;months. Hospital admission data and survival data were obtained from national registers. During 8&#x000a0;years of follow-up the intervention group had 41% less fatal and non-fatal first recurrent CVD rate, and 45% less recurrent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rate than the reference group. The study was powered to examine the combined endpoint of fatal and nonfatal recurrent coronary event rate and found a positive significant difference between groups (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.83, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003). Subsequent analyses found a significantly reduced nonfatal recurrent acute myocardial infarction rate (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36-0.85, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007), but no significant difference in all-cause-mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.40-1.30, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28). During the first 2&#x000a0;years of follow-up there were no significant group differences in quality of life, but the intervention group had a significantly stronger optimism about the future. The CBT stress intervention decreased the risk of recurrent CVD and recurrent AMI. A dose-response relationship between therapy attendance rate and risk was observed. This has implications for targeting and strengthening of secondary preventive programs in CHD patients.</p><p id="__p1743">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Neil Schneiderman, PhD, Psychology, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, 33124-0751; nschneid@miami.edu</p><p id="__p1744">SS04c</p><p id="__p1745">COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY MAY PROLONG LIVES OF WOMEN WITH CORONARY DISEASE.

In Stockholm women, we found marital stress to be a stronger predictor than job stress, but behavioral interventions to reduce such psychosocial stressors in women had not been identified. Based on previous findings, we implemented a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program for women and investigated its ability to improve survival in women coronary patients. Consecutive women patients, aged 75&#x000a0;years or younger, hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, or percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to group-based CBT or to usual care. Intervention groups of 4 to 8 women met for a total of 20 sessions that were spread over a year. We provided education about risk factors, relaxation training techniques, methods for self-monitoring and cognitive restructuring, with an emphasis on coping with stress exposure from family and work, self-care and compliance with medical advice. From randomization until end of follow-up (mean duration, 7.1&#x000a0;years), 25 women (20%) in the usual care and 8 women (7%) in the CBT condition died, yielding an almost three fold protective effect of the intervention (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.33; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.74; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007). Controlling for relevant demographic and medical prognostic factors in multivariate models, confirmed the unadjusted results. CBT improved survival independently of medication with statins. Additionally, an interactive effect of statins with behavioral intervention was suggested. In women who received both treatments, only one woman died, (1.5 %) as compared to 15 out of 70 (22 %) women who received none of the treatments(p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007). We concluded that a group-based CBT program for women with coronary disease may prolong their lives.

Often, the disorder occurs in comorbidity with additional functional symptoms like chronic pelvic pain, fatigue or psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression. Females suffer at least twice as often from FGD than men. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent FGD and research shows a strong association between chronic stress and trauma in these patients. Due to the increasing knowledge on psychobiological mechanisms regulating adaptive processes to stress, research focuses on functional syndromes, which seem to be associated with maladaption of biological stress regulatory systems. This symposium refers to the different biological factors contributing to the etiology and maintenance of IBS. Besides prevalence rates on the high number of females with IBS, naturally occurring variation of female life conditions like menstrual cycle will be discussed with respect to the occurrence of IBS symptoms. Additionally, data on different biological systems like the HPA axis, pain perception, serotonergic pathways will be presented with reference to IBS and possible treatment approaches.</p><p id="__p1761">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Ulrike Ehlert, PhD, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Zurich, Zurich, 8050; u.ehlert@psychologie.uzh.ch</p><p id="__p1762">SS06a</p><p id="__p1763">PSYCHOBIOLOGICAL STRESS RESPONSIVENESS TO NATURALLY OCCURRING AND LABORATORY INDUCED PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS IN WOMEN WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</p><p id="__p1764">Kerstin A.

The physiological mechanisms between stress and gut disturbances, however, are incompletely understood. The current studies aimed to investigate the association between different stressors and functional gastrointestinal (FGI) complaints in female IBS patients and healthy controls.</p><p id="__p1767">Methods: In an Internet-based survey conducted in a large number of students, the prevalence of FGI symptoms and perceived stress (chronic stress, coping strategies, stress reactivity) were measured. In a second trial basal and stimulated HPA axis activity was assessed in 57 women with IBS and 20 matched controls. IBS diagnosis was made according the Rome III criteria and psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using a clinical interview. Salivary morning cortisol and diurnal profile were obtained and a standardized psychosocial stress test (TSST) was applied. Cortisol and ACTH were measured before and within one hour following the stressor.</p><p id="__p1768">Results: Two third of the online study sample (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;668) reported FGI complaints which were significantly predicted by female gender, high levels of chronic stress, dispositional stress reactivity, and use of maladaptive coping. The biological results indicated that female IBS patients have intact circadian rhythmicity of the HPA axis. However, women with diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D) exhibited substantially heightened cortisol at awakening and nearly no morning increase. In response to the laboratory stressor significantly blunted cortisol (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and slightly attenuated ACTH secretion was observed in patients compared to controls. In the recovery period ACTH levels were significantly lower in patients than in healthy subjects (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Women with IBS perceived higher general and situation specific stress susceptibility.</p><p id="__p1769">Conclusions: FGI syndromes, including IBS, seem to be common in apparently healthy subjects whereas female gender is a predictor. Several naturally occurring stressors are associated with the presence of FGI symptoms. In both studies psychological stress measures were overall increased in the IBS group and propose heightened stress susceptibility. Biological data indicate an association between basal HPA axis activity and predominant bowel habit. Furthermore, the downregulated HPA axis reactivity in women with IBS following the laboratory stressor (TSST) suggests an attenuated sensitivity of the endocrine system. The strong relationship between stress experience and the occurrence of IBS indicates that stress-reducing interventions may be beneficial in such individuals.</p><p id="__p1770">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Kerstin A.

Short-term depletion of tryptophan from food (called acute tryptophan depletion, ATD) has been shown to provoke the respective symptoms both in healthy volunteers as well as in patients, but seems to work predominantly in women. Therefore, gender differences must exist in the serotonin metabolism and its utilization in the brain and in the periphery. In addition, genetic predisposition has been shown to exist that determines - among others - the effectiveness of serotoninergic interventions in patients, with drugs as well as with nutrients.

In children, the rubric of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) includes IBS, functional abdominal pain, and likely, dyspepsia. Prior to puberty there is an equal proportion of boys and girls with a diagnosis of RAP. The factors responsible for the divergence in prevalence after puberty are not clear. Studies suggest that both environmental (i.e., increased risk if a parent has IBS) and gender factors (i.e., changes in hormonal milieu) likely play a role. The incidence of IBS in both men and women appears to decrease in late middle age. The severity of GI symptoms, including abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and bloating, varies across phases of the menstrual cycle as well as during the menopause transition in some women with or without IBS or other functional GI disorders. A limited number of studies indicate that premenses (days immediately preceding the onset of menses) and menses, compared with other cycle phases, are periods of increased GI symptom distress in women age 19-37. Women with IBS experience a greater impact of menstrual cycle on symptoms as compared to those without IBS. While not extensively studied, oral contraceptives appear to modestly reduce but not eliminate GI symptoms in those with IBS. This paper will present they hypothesis that declining or low ovarian hormone levels underlies the occurrence or exacerbations of abdominal pain/discomfort across the menstrual cycle and the perimenopause-early menopause transition in women with or without IBS.</p><p id="__p1792">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Margaret Heitkemper, PhD, BNHS, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195; heit@u.washington.edu</p><p id="__p1793">SS07</p><p id="__p1794">TRAJECTORIES OF HEALTH AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN RELATION TO RETIREMENT AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS</p><p id="__p1795">Hugo Westerlund, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Jussi Vahtera, MD, PhD<sup>2,3</sup> and Archana Singh-Manoux, PhD<sup>4</sup>\n</p><p id="__p1796"><sup>1</sup>Stress Research Institute, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden; <sup>2</sup>Department of Public Health, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland; <sup>3</sup>Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland and <sup>4</sup>U687, INSERM, Villejuif, France.</p><p id="__p1797">Increased availalability of data and recent developments in longitudinal modelling improve the possibilities to understand the long-term development of health.

Data were collected by questionnaire each year from 1989 through 2007 inclusive.</p><p id="__p1807">Main Outcome Measures: Respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke, mental fatigue, and physical fatigue, measured each year of the 15-year observation period, and depressive symptoms, measured at four time points.</p><p id="__p1808">Results: Repeated-measures logistic regression with generalized estimating equations showed that the cumulative prevalence of respiratory diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease and stroke increased with age, with no break in the trend around retirement.

The effects of retirement on the risk of specific diseases with major public health importance are unknown. Because poor adherence to treatment can increase the risk of severe medical complications, we examined if retirement is followed by a change in the use of antihypertensive medication among individuals with chronic hypertension.</p><p id="__p1816">Methods: We linked an occupational cohort of 1820 retired employees in Finland (71% women) entitled to special reimbursement due to chronic hypertension before retirement to national health and prescription registers. The prescription register contains data on the exact dates and defined daily dosages of every purchase of prescription drugs. Annual use of antihypertensive medication was measured for each year during a period covering 4&#x000a0;years before and 4&#x000a0;years after the year of retirement.</p><p id="__p1817">Results: Repeated-measures showed that adherence was significantly better in the years after retirement compared to the years before retirement. The ratio of mean number of days not covered by purchased prescribed drugs in the four years following, compared with the four years preceding, retirement was 0.74 (95% CI 0.67&#x02013;0.81) after adjustment for sex, age at retirement, occupational status and year of retirement. This improvement in adherence was observed in both sexes, in all occupational grades and irrespective of type of retirement. However, the improvement in adherence following retirement was significantly greater among employees with high job strain before retirement compared to the others: the mean ratio of days not covered by prescribed drugs in the post-retirement years compared to the pre-retirement years 0.58 (95% CI 0.47-0.70) in the high strain group and 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.87) in the low strain group (test of interaction, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0004). Further adjustments for baseline health indicators had little effect on these associations.</p><p id="__p1818">Conclusions: Repeated measurements provide evidence for a substantial and sustained increase in adherence to medical treatment among individuals with chronic hypertension following retirement. Poor adherence before retirement is more common among individuals exposed to high work stress. Because inadequate treatment of chronic hypertension increases the risk of severe medical complications, our findings suggest that the retirement-related relief of work-stress may decrease the risk of complications in high-risk populations.</p><p id="__p1819">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hugo Westerlund, PhD, Stress Research Institute, Stockholm, SE-106 91; hugo.westerlund@stress.su.se</p><p id="__p1820">SS07c</p><p id="__p1821">SOCIO-ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DIAGNOSIS-SPECIFIC SICKNESS ABSENCE AND SUBSEQUENT SUSTAINED SUB-OPTIMAL HEALTH: A 14-YEAR FOLLOW-UP IN THE GAZEL COHORT</p><p id="__p1822">Jane E.

Prospective occupational cohort of 15,320 employees (73% men) aged 37 to 51, of whom 30% were in higher, 55% intermediate, and 15% in the lower occupational grades.

In this new situation a window of opportunity opened for knowledge exchange between academia, practice and municipal policy makers. Academia was expected to produce research evidence for applicable and cost effective interventions and policies. On the other hand, academia lacked contextual information necessary for tailored research evidence. Collaboration between these different stakeholders has proved to be challenging. The Danish model consists of 3&#x000a0;year contracts for junior researcher-practitioner positions, co-funded by the university and municipalities with the aim to carry out scientific project-based research relevant to municipalities. The 1st year evaluation of the collaboration with 3 case municipalities has shown as major benefits: increased access and use of research-based working methods in the municipalities; image lift of the municipalities; concrete products such as usable research results and lectures delivered; and support in project implementation. On the other hand, problems or challenges experienced have been: different working traditions and time scales; translating complicated research results into immediate and applicable practical know-how; lack of time and capacity for knowledge exchange; and sometimes lack of mutual respect and trust between stakeholders. All in all, collaboration and knowledge exchange has already in the 1st year lead to longer-term collaborative health policy planning; increased knowledge exchange; and also to an interest to start an evidence-based knowledge center within the area of health promotion. Challenges ahead lie in developing capacity building among all stakeholder groups; organizational barriers; development of &#x02018;service packages&#x02019; including contextually tailored research information e.g. of health profiles of communities; implementation in practice and policy making as well as long-term follow-up of the implementation.</p><p id="__p1849">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Arja R.

Peers for Progress of the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation is dedicated to accelerating the availability of best practices in peer support around the world. A major challenge is how to develop a coherent model of peer support that is applicable across widely differing cultural, organizational, and national settings. &#x0201c;Standardization by function, not content&#x0201d; guided development of a coherent yet broadly applicable and flexible model. Through a WHO consultation with experts from 20 different countries, literature review, and work with 14 grantees representing 9 countries, four key functions of peer support have been identified: assistance in daily management, social and emotional support, linkage to clinical care, and ongoing availability of support. These are implemented in varied ways, by telephone, individual meetings, group meetings, etc. but have been found applicable across varied settings. A second challenge is how to promote best practices in something that is as old as primates and widely implemented around the world. This has led to emphasis on promoting a coherent model of support around the key functions described above, but, then, working with existing programs to encourage information and model sharing, knowledge management, and advocacy through networks and collaborations focused at the national and regional level. Eventually, a network of networks would link peer support programs around the world, facilitating their quality improvement, helping them to achieve recognition of peer support as a key component of care through their own health systems, and, thereby, increasing their ability to reach the millions they might benefit.</p><p id="__p1871">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Edwin B.

The participants were asked a signed consent for linkage of the survey data to national health and pension registers which was given by 92%. In 2007, the survey material was completed by Statistics Finland with data on mortality and by the Finnish Centre for Pensions with data on cumulative incidence of disability pensions and rehabilitation allowance from 1998 to 2006.

Violent mortality was higher for non-respondent men in age brackets 30-34 and 40-44&#x000a0;years but not for any age group of women. Disease mortality was higher for non-respondent women in age group 50-54&#x000a0;years but not for any age group of men.

Psychobiological factors may be mediators of these differences. The differences appear to occur as a gradient, rather than in distinct classes. Explanations offered for these differences may be classified into two possibly interacting categories: structural factors and individual factors. In this study we examine how individually acquired expectancies of being able or unable to handle the stressors and challenges of everyday life relate to individual health and to the socioeconomic gradient. According to the Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress (CATS) learned response outcome expectancies affect health through health behaviours and stress responses.</p><p id="__p1916">Methods: A cross-sectional study of response outcome expectancies, socioeconomic status and health in the 2008 follow-up of a representative sample of the Swedish working population in 2003-2005 (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;11441).</p><p id="__p1917">Findings: Response expectancy variables (coping, helplessness, and hopelessness) showed clear and monotonous gradients over a Socioeconomic Status (SES) ladder. Multiple regression analysis revealed that coping was related to subjective SES, but could not be explained by age, gender, or objective SES. After controlling for age and gender, response outcome expectancies explained more variance (r2&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.162) in self-rated health than subjective and objective socioeconomic status (r2&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.078).</p><p id="__p1918">Interpretation: The results indicate that there are systematic differences in coping across the socioeconomic ladder.

Theory-based health communication interventions aim to increase awareness and screening for this disease. The Health Belief Model is one of the most used models on which behavior change interventions and their evaluations are based. Previous work has been conducted to develop quality assessments of the Health Belief Model constructs in both breast and more recently in colorectal cancer contexts. However, instrument development initiatives have not focused specifically on disparities-affected populations such as African Americans. We present adapted instruments to assess Health Belief Model constructs, that were adapted/enriched based on qualitative research (e.g., focus groups) among African Americans. Two brief scales assess barriers to colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test, specific to the healthcare system. Internal consistencies were modest (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.33; &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.43, respectively) and may indicate multidimensionality. A third scale assesses additional areas of colorectal cancer knowledge (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;78), based on the qualitative research findings. Factor structures and other psychometric properties are reported. Scores on the instruments were associated with screening behaviors. This work is consistent with the recent special issue of Health Education and Behavior, on &#x0201c;Behavioral Constructs and Culture for Cancer Screening&#x0201d;, in which it is suggested that traditional behavior change theories developed for mainstream US culture may need to be adapted when working with disparities-affected populations such as racial/ethnic minorities.</p><p id="__p1926">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Cheryl L.

Moreover, only little research has been done to examine the pathway through which SI affects health. Therefore we analysed the mediating effect of effort-reward imbalance at work (ERI) on this association. Methods: Analyses were based on a random sample of 1111 male employees (25-64&#x000a0;years) from the south-west of Germany. Data were collected by a telephone interview in 2008/09. Information on socio-demographic variables, social status indicators (education, occupational grade and income), occupational strain (ERI), and physical as well as mental health (SF-12) were given. Results: SI was significantly associated to low mental health, both directly and, consistent to our hypothesis, indirectly via low rewards. As SI was also related to low effort, no association was found for the quotient of both scales (ERI) and mental health. The effect of SI on physical health was entirely mediated by low rewards without any direct effect. The inclusion of further risk factors (age, BMI) did not attenuate these results. Conclusions: SI is significantly associated to ill health. Moreover, results indicate that at least a part of this relationship is explained by low rewards at work, findings with implications for further research in job strain and health inequality.</p><p id="__p1945">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Stefanie Braig, MA, Institute of Epidemiology, Ulm University, Ulm, 89081; stefanie.braig@uni-ulm-de</p><p id="__p1946">11:24&#x000a0;AM-11:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p1947">OS08-D</p><p id="__p1948">RETURN TO WORK IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE HAND INJURIES</p><p id="__p1949">Lonneke Opsteegh, MSc,<sup>1,2</sup> Heleen A.

Aim of this study was to investigate which factors determine RTW.</p><p id="__p1952">Methods: Patients with acute hand injuries (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;69) answered several questionnaires on biomedical, work-related and psychosocial factors. All patients were between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years, employed, had sustained an acute hand injury and were treated in one of the two participating rehabilitation centers.</p><p id="__p1953">Results: Primary outcome measure was RTW, dichotomized into early (&#x02264;10&#x000a0;weeks) and late RTW (&#x0003e;10&#x000a0;weeks). The majority of the patients (55%) returned to work in the late stage. Six percent of the patients did not RTW within one year, and 4% failed to RTW. Accident location (Chi2:10.101; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001), job independence (U&#x02009;=&#x02009;372.000; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.021) and symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (S-PTSD) (U&#x02009;=&#x02009;257.000; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001) were univariately associated with RTW, and were entered in the logistic regression analysis. Both S-PTSD (having more symptoms) and accident location (accident sustained on the job) were found to statistically predict late RTW in hand-injured patients.</p><p id="__p1954">Exploration of S-PTSD: As S-PTSD are predictors of RTW in patients with acute hand-injuries, it is relevant to investigate which patients develop S-PTSD, and which patients do not. Therefore, we investigated which factors predict S-PTSD in this population. Pain (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.530; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), satisfaction with hand function (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.&#x02212;.451; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), aesthetics (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.320; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.009), palliative coping style (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.281; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.022) and avoidant coping style (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.283; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.022) were univariately associated to S-PTSD.

Furthermore, patients should regularly be checked for S-PTSD, especially if the aesthetics of the hand are severely disturbed, or when patients experience pain.</p><p id="__p1956">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lonneke Opsteegh, MSc, Center for Rehabilitation, UMCG, Groningen, 9700 RB; l.opsteegh@cvr.umcg.nl</p><p id="__p1957">11:42&#x000a0;AM-12:00&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p1958">OS08-E</p><p id="__p1959">MANAGING LOW BACK PAIN IN THE WORK PLACE - PROBLEMS AND STRATEGIES</p><p id="__p1960">Torill H.

The purpose of this study was to identify workplace challenges and self-management strategies reported by workers remaining at work despite recurrent or persistent LBP, to be used as a framework for the development of a workplace group intervention to prevent back disability. Workers with LBP (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) participated in 5 focus groups, and audio recordings of sessions were analyzed to assemble lists of common problems and coping strategies. A separate analysis provided a general categorization of major themes. Workplace pain problems fell within 4 domains: activity interference; negative self-perceptions; interpersonal challenges; and inflexibility of work. Self-management strategies consisted of: modifying work activities and routines; reducing pain symptoms; using cognitive strategies; and communicating pain effectively. Theme extraction identified 6 overarching themes: knowing your work setting; talking about pain; being prepared for a bad day; thoughts and emotions; keeping moving; and finding leeway. To retain workers with LBP, this qualitative investigation suggests future intervention efforts should focus on worker communication and cognitions related to pain, pacing of work, and employer efforts to provide leeway for altered job routines.</p><p id="__p1963">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Torill H.

Participants rated items (-3: strongly disagree to +3: strongly agree) assessing Testing Intention, Decisional Conflict, Test Perceived Efficiency, Benefits from Finding out Results, Disease Coherence (understanding the conditions genetic nature) and Worry (about having a disabled child).

In the non-expectant group, however, Decisional Conflict was associated with low Test Efficiency (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;23) and greater Benefits from Positive Results (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.22).

We used mixed methods to better understand these disparities. We conducted seven focus groups on CRC prevention with obese (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30) white and African American women (age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50) who were not currently adherent to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;31). Discussions and coding were guided by the Health Belief Model. Focus groups were followed by an online survey with 109 obese and 89 non-obese women. We used Chi-square to compare weight groups on screening barriers. Focus group revealed that women did not believe they were at risk for CRC and had poor knowledge of CRC prevention; they did not clearly understand the role of weight or screening in cancer prevention. Many were unaware of potential risk factors for CRC and were much more aware of potential screening barriers than benefits. Cost and time were the most frequently cited barriers to screening. Further investigation revealed that women&#x02019;s time and healthcare dollars were focused on more pressing co-morbidities. While most women relied on their physician to bring up important health issues, the internet was their most frequent source of prevention information. Survey data confirmed that obese women were more likely than non-obese women to agree they had too many other health costs (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.049) or more important health concerns that took precedence over colonoscopy (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045). There were no significant differences by weight group in agreement with the more general cost and time barriers to colonoscopy. Furthermore, a higher proportion (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) of obese women (41.1%) agreed that screening tests were embarrassing compared to on-obese women (28.6%). Obese women were more than twice as likely as non-obese women to agree that they would not need a screening if they did not have symptoms (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). Treatment of obesity-related co-morbidities may take precedence over cancer prevention in primary care. Messages which focus on prevention and screening benefits may improve healthy behaviors in obese women.</p><p id="__p1993">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lucia A.

In addition, the health care impact of IBS also appears to be greater in women as compared to men. Women with IBS commonly report other somatic and visceral symptoms. Muscle and joint pain and disturbed sleep patterns are among the most common and the most distressing. Gender differences exist in types of GI symptoms (women report greater problems with constipation while men more frequently report diarrhea) as well as other extra-intestinal symptoms. The role of menstrual cycle in IBS symptom reporting is based on observations that women with IBS frequently report cyclic changes in their symptom severity. Women with IBS often report other menstrual cycle linked conditions including migraine headache, dysmenorrhea and premenstrual dysphoria distress syndrome.</p><p id="__p2012">Gender differences in IBS begin to emerge at puberty. In children, the rubric of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) includes IBS, functional abdominal pain, and likely, dyspepsia. Prior to puberty there is an equal proportion of boys and girls with a diagnosis of RAP. The factors responsible for the divergence in prevalence after puberty are not clear. Studies suggest that both environmental (i.e., increased risk if a parent has IBS) and gender factors (i.e., changes in hormonal milieu) likely play a role. The incidence of IBS in both men and women appears to decrease in late middle age. The severity of GI symptoms, including abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and bloating, varies across phases of the menstrual cycle as well as during the menopause transition in some women with or without IBS or other functional GI disorders. A limited number of studies indicate that premenses (days immediately preceding the onset of menses) and menses, compared with other cycle phases, are periods of increased GI symptom distress in women age 19-37. Women with IBS experience a greater impact of menstrual cycle on symptoms as compared to those without IBS. While not extensively studied, oral contraceptives appear to modestly reduce but not eliminate GI symptoms in those with IBS. This paper will present they hypothesis that declining or low ovarian hormone levels underlies the occurrence or exacerbations of abdominal pain/discomfort across the menstrual cycle and the perimenopause-early menopause transition in women with or without IBS.</p><p id="__p2013">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Margaret Heitkemper, PhD, BNHS, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195; heit@u.washington.edu</p><p id="__p2014">10:48&#x000a0;AM-11:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p2015">OS10-B</p><p id="__p2016">ASSOCIATIONS OF THE PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) WITH DEPRESSIVE - AND SOMATOFORM SYMPTOMS</p><p id="__p2017">Corinne Spoerri, MS,<sup>1</sup> Suzana Drobnjak, MS,<sup>1</sup> Dominique Wueest, MS,<sup>1</sup> Ulrike Ehlert, PhD<sup>1</sup> and Beate Ditzen, PhD<sup>1,2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p2018"><sup>1</sup>Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Zurich, Switzerland and <sup>2</sup>Dept. of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, GA.</p><p id="__p2019">Objective: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are psychiatric phenomena, which are associated with the menstrual cycle in women.

The challenge for the general practitioners (GP) is that the majority of these cases tend to be unspecific without any clear and significant objective findings. Traditional medical thinking requires a diagnosis, in order to find a specific and efficient therapy or to grant sickness certificate. The challenge is to find the proper diagnoses when the condition is unspecific, with many complaints, and a high level of comorbidity. The International Classification of Primary Care-second version (ICPC-2) is used in Norwegian primary health care.</p><p id="__p2041">Aims: Our aims were to investigate if a dramatised case story (presented exactly the same way to, Norwegian GPs), representing a patient with unspecific and/or comorbid complaints get the same diagnosis and decision on sick leave.</p><p id="__p2042">Method: Fifty-six GPs watched 10 case stories and diagnosed each case with ICPC-2 diagnosis and made decisions on whether to sick list or not.</p><p id="__p2043">Results: Between 15 and 23 ICPC-2 diagnoses were given to the case stories as main diagnosis. Psychological diagnoses were most frequent, followed by musculoskeletal. Three to five different ICPC-2 organ chapters were used for each case. Decisions on sick leave yes/no and different type of insurance benefits varied greatly within each case story.</p><p id="__p2044">Discussion: As expected, the Norwegian GPs did not agree on which diagnoses to use for these patients, and suggested a high number of diagnostic labels from the ICPC-2 system. This is, in our opinion, not an indication of lack of competence in the GPs but that the systems used today are unable to classify and describe these complaints. The high number of possible diagnoses offered by experienced GPs suggests that the conditions are composite, with a high level of comorbidity and the diagnostic system is unable to identify this. For this kind of patients there is no consensus on what kind of treatment to offer and we argue that the only available &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d; today is sick leave. This increases the risk of long term sick leave, and permanent disability.</p><p id="__p2045">Conclusion: Case stories with unspecific and comorbid complaints are diagnosed with a large variety of ICPC-2 diagnosis in general practice and they are frequently put on sick leave.</p><p id="__p2046">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Silje Maeland, Msc, Stress, Health and Rehabilitation, Uni Health, Bergen, 5015; silje.maeland@uni.no</p><p id="__p2047">OS11</p><p id="__p2048">10:30&#x000a0;AM-10:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p2049">OS11-A</p><p id="__p2050">ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES, HEALTH RISK BEHAVIOURS AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY: COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN INCARCERATED WOMEN AND MEN</p><p id="__p2051">Angela Maia, phd and Joana Alves, dr</p><p id="__p2052">Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.</p><p id="__p2053">Context: History of childhood adversity, health risk behaviours and psychopathology are prevalent phenomenon in the detained population, but most studies were done with men.

The differences between women and men in what concerns adverse childhood experiences and psychopathological symptoms suggest more adverse childhood histories for incarcerated women. Those differences should be better explored in order to understand if a self-report effect or a fact of their lives.

A quasi-random sample of about 3,000 female respondents between the ages of 13 and 25 from secondary schools and colleges/universities from the capital city of each country together with one rural district was surveyed using a standardized self-administered structured questionnaire. Each country data set was processed and analyzed using SPSS version 12.

Socio-cultural factors such as parental and peer tobacco use and exposure to direct and indirect pro-tobacco advertising are important predictors of smoking in all countries. For example, Malaysian female students are four times more likely to smoke if their mothers smoke. Having close friends who smoke is another significant predictor (range between four to over ten times more likely to smoke). Indonesian and Philippines female students exposed to tobacco advertising and promotion are twice as likely to smoke compared to females without such exposure. The study also found that females with pro-smoking attitudes, positive image of smoking and a perception that smoking is the norm among people their age are more likely to smoke. Tobacco control policies in these countries are found to influence female smoking rates.</p><p id="__p2120">Conclusion: To protect girls and women as well as boys and men, all ASEAN countries should implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, prioritizing raising of taxes on all tobacco products, introduction of comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion and prohibition of smoking in public places.</p><p id="__p2121">Learning Objectives:</p><p id="__p2122">At the end of this presentation participants will be able to:</p><p id="__p2123">i.

From the internal documents of the tobacco industry which was forced into public domain in the United States of America, it was revealed that the tobacco industry had deliberately marketed to young and underage persons in Nigeria. It was also revealed that British American Tobacco (BAT) had conducted several surveys to determine the rate of youth smoking in Nigeria. In one of such survey minors were referred to as YAUS (Young and Underage Smokers).</p><p id="__p2132">METHODS: Experience Freshness was a recent promotion of the British America Tobacco in August 2008. This event was organized to promote the Pall Mall brand. It was organized in all the six geo political zones in the country and was heavy on young people. Invitation cards were secretly given out in secondary schools and colleges. It was a heavy all night smoking party. Research and experience has showed various trick and strategies of the tobacco industries. It is therefore appropriate to implement laws that will curb every secret parties and advert used to promote its new product &#x0201c;Pall Mall&#x0201d; in developing countries especially Nigeria.

Interpretations varied with whether genes and behaviour were conceived as health-damaging or health-protecting, suggesting a role for message framing in motivating behaviour change. Winfried Rief presents the results of a study evaluating the impact of presenting genetic risk information to obese patients.

Extant research has featured difficulty measuring public understandings of this relationship. This essay explores public understanding of the relationship between genes and behavior, especially with regard to the mathematical relationships to risk contribution. It also contributes a psychometrically valid scale for measuring beliefs about gene-behavior relationships. Methods: Three population representative surveys (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;633, 658, 1218) were conducted using the Knowledge Networks panel platform. Results: Interpretations of risk vary depending on whether genes and behavior are conceived of as health-damaging (loss frame) or health-protecting (gain frame). In the loss frame, the majority of the population adopts an additive model of the relationship with approximately one third adopting an amplificative model. Scores on the non-mathematically based scale indicate higher belief in the existence of interaction than scores on the more concrete question format. Conclusions: The existence of different interpretations of gene-behavior relationships based on gain/loss frame and abstract/concrete modes indicates the need to select frame and mode carefully in both teaching and research. Research is needed to identify optimal configurations for teaching and presenting this relatively complex material.</p><p id="__p2163">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Celeste M.

Moreover, if obesity has developed, it is difficult to control weight, and unsuccessful and disappointing weight reduction programs are frequent. In this study we wanted to investigate whether information about the genetic background of obesity is helpful for affected people to develop realistic goals and reduce negative self-perceptions. After genetic screenings of 1000 obese people, we included 320 for a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of genetic information versus general information (without genetic content) in obesity. A subgroup of 16 participants was confirmed for functionally relevant MC4R mutations, and they received consultation with genetic information. Their results were analyzed in detail. The acceptance of a consultation including genetic information was high, and those people with a family history of obesity appreciated to receive genetic information in the consultation. People with MC4R mutations reported less feelings of shame and guilt and more realistic weight loss goals after the intervention. We conclude that consultation for obese people should include information about genetic backgrounds, especially if obesity-relevant genetic mutations are obvious, or if people have a family history of obesity.</p><p id="__p2169">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Winfried Rief, PhD, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Marburg, Marburg, 35032; rief@staff.uni-marburg.de</p><p id="__p2170">SS08c</p><p id="__p2171">PRESENTING COHERENT LINKS BETWEEN RISKS AND ACTION: IMPACT ON BELIEFS MOTIVATING BEHAVIOR AND EXPECTED VALUE OF GENETIC TESTS</p><p id="__p2172">Linda D.

Given the challenges in understanding how behavior can reduce genetically-conferred risk, there is a need to identify how to present information to optimize comprehension and adaptive behavior. Guided by the Common-Sense Model, we tested whether information about links between physiological processes underlying genetic risk, disease development, and behavior enhances beliefs motivating protective action and alters willingness to buy tests. We tested the impact of this information for genetic tests versus tests of a non-genetic biomarker, at higher versus lower risk levels, and when presenting risk information in graphic versus numeric formats. In an internet-based factorial design experiment, 782 adults responded to messages about a test for colorectal cancer risk. We varied messages by risk-action link information (provision or no provision of information describing how a low-fat diet reduces cancer risk given a positive result), risk increment (20%, 50%, or 80% risk given a positive result), risk format (numeric or graphic presentation of risk increments), and test type (genetic or enzyme test). ANOVAs revealed that providing risk-action link information enhanced beliefs of response efficacy (that low-fat diets reduce disease risk) and coherence (understanding how low-fat diets reduce risk), and lowered appraisals of anticipated risk with a low-fat diet (p&#x02019;s&#x0003c;.0001). These effects held across risk increments, risk formats, and test types. For genetic tests, provision of risk-action link information reduced the amount individuals were willing to pay for the test (p&#x0003c;.0001). Brief explanations of how action can reduce biomarker-detected risks promoted beliefs motivating protective action; paradoxically, by enhancing understanding of behavioral control over the risk, they reduced the value of genetic risk information.</p><p id="__p2175">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Linda D.

Communicating genetic information may increase medication adherence, but may also negatively impact motivation to quit if the initial attempt fails. We investigated the impact of genetic feedback on medication adherence and motivation to quit. We tested (1) whether adherence to NRT is greater following genetic (OPRM1 genotype) compared to phenotypic (heaviness of smoking) feedback, and (2) whether smokers who relapsed showed lower motivation to make another attempt following genetic compared to phenotypic feedback.</p><p id="__p2181">The study was an open label, parallel group randomised trial (ISRCTN: 14352545) conducted in primary care. Adult smokers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;633) were prescribed NRT patch, randomised to a top-up dose of NRT based explicitly either on OPRM1 genotype or heaviness of smoking and followed for 6-months. Outcomes measures were: proportion of prescribed NRT consumed in the first 28&#x000a0;days; and motivation to make another quit attempt among those not abstinent at 6-month follow-up.</p><p id="__p2182">There was a significant effect of genetic feedback compared to phenotypic feedback on adherence at 7-day follow-up (75% vs 69%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.040), and a marginally non-significant effect at 28-day follow-up (69% vs 64%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.098). There were similar effects on abstinence at six-month follow-up (14% vs 8%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018). Amongst those not abstinent at 6-month follow-up, there was no difference in motivation to make another quit attempt between trial arms (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23).</p><p id="__p2183">This is the first test of the behavioural impact of pharmacogenetic feedback. Genetic feedback had a measurable impact on short-term medication adherence and abstinence at 6-month follow-up compared to phenotypic feedback, and appears to offer modest improvements to medication adherence to medication, and NRT effectiveness. This suggests potential for an important population impact.</p><p id="__p2184">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Theresa M.

The American Cancer Society estimates that 1 in 5 men will get prostate cancer sometime during his lifetime, and that 1 man in 35 will die of this disease. The society also estimates that more than 2 million men in the United States who have prostate cancer at some point are still alive today. Much of the current treatment for cancer (including surgery and hormone therapy) involves temporary or permanent impotence or urinary incontinence which would be distressing for all men but particularly for those who are invested in their sexual performance or being in control as signs of their masculinity. Men may therefore forego treatment or delay it, leading to increasing risk of complications from prostate cancer. Presenters in this symposium will look at the impact of male sex role norms (including emotional restriction, emphasis on sexual ability, and being independent) on diagnosis for prostate cancer as well as recovery from treatment. They will examine the kinds of responses men have to being diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer, the type of support they seek and find useful after treatment, and the role partners can play in helping men cope.</p><p id="__p2190">SS09a</p><p id="__p2191">PROSTATE CANCER: MALE NORMS AND THE CONCEPT OF SUPPORT</p><p id="__p2192">Betsy Bates, MA</p><p id="__p2193">Antioch University, Santa Barbara, CA.</p><p id="__p2194">This presentation will summarize recent findings from the literature on psychological issues related to diagnosis, the seeking of psychological support, and threats to male identity posed by treatment options that can interfere with potency and continence. Qualitative studies, for example, point to a number of reasons why men may be diagnosed late, including a reluctance to appear weak (by reporting symptoms); embarrassment, guardedness and denial about vulnerability related to their bodies; powerlessness within the medical system, and the fear of a diagnosis that goes to the deepest core of masculinity, the prostate. A recent literature review highlighted clinically meaningful take-home messages, including the fact that men tend to either retreat inward following the diagnosis of cancer, keeping their feelings and worries to themselves, or rely heavily on a partner for emotional support.</p><p id="__p2195">Studies contained in the review demonstrate that both men and women benefit equally from psychosocial support. When asked, men say that they want information rather than emotional support from psychosocial oncology teams; yet in online forums, men&#x02019;s supportive exchanges are clearly emotional, couched in dark humor and unifying battlefield terminology. The fact that men enthusiastically participate in emotional support offered at a distance (often anonymously) raises interesting questions about future directions for cancer support, which will be addressed. Also of significance is mens&#x02019; highly consistent reliance on partners for support during cancer treatment, a finding that points to the possible unmet needs of men who are not in secure relationships during the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.</p><p id="__p2196">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Betsy Bates, MA, Antioch University, Santa Barbara, CA, 93103; betsybates@aol.com</p><p id="__p2197">SS09b</p><p id="__p2198">INTIMACY-ENHANCING PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR MEN DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER AND THEIR PARTNERS: A PILOT STUDY</p><p id="__p2199">Sharon Manne, PhD</p><p id="__p2200">Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA</p><p id="__p2201">Objective: The diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer can stress the marital relationship and compromise its quality.

Hoyt, PhD</p><p id="__p2210">Health Psychology, University of California Merced, Merced, CA.</p><p id="__p2211">Although the psychosocial impact of cancer treatment varies across cancer patients, many experience some psychological distress following diagnosis. In addition to the emotional experience, men with prostate cancer often face myriad physical complications including impotence, urinary and bowel incontinence, and sleep disturbance affecting quality of life. The time immediately following treatment can be a critical period marked by increased feelings of fear, uncertainty, and loss of control. Such emotional responses may be experienced as inconsistent with psychological attributes often associated with traditional gender role norms, such as strength, independence, and emotional inexpressiveness. Evidence of the negative impact of suppressing emotions, and positive impact of expressing and processing emotions on psychological distress, physical health, and overall adjustment to cancer is growing. Drawing upon examples from the author&#x02019;s past and current research with men with prostate cancer, the relationship of gender-related influences on emotional approach coping efforts will be discussed within a stress and coping framework. Emotional approach coping (EAC) refers to strategies that involve acknowledging, understanding, and expressing emotions, and has been found to be associated with decreased distress and better adjustment in breast cancer patients, though little work has examined EAC in men with prostate cancer. Observations in healthy populations suggest that EAC varies by gender and has been linked to both better and poorer adjustment in men. Prior research in men with cancer found that gender role norms shape EAC processes, and that the interpersonal environment and age may be important contextual variables characterizing its utility in men with cancer. Current research examining the impact of masculine cancer threat, gender-linked personality factors, and gender role norms on health-related quality of life following treatment for prostate cancer will be highlighted.</p><p id="__p2212">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Michael A.

Among parents of children with chronic illnesses, symptoms of anxiety and depression are more prevalent; however, less is known about the impact of parent emotions on diabetes care behaviors. This study assesses anxiety and depression in parents of young children with T1D and explores its relationship to diabetes management, including parent reported overall dietary adherence, recall data on frequency of BG checks and diet/meals, BG variability, and A1c.</p><p id="__p2219">As part of an ongoing RCT of parenting support, 60 primary caregivers (90% female; 75% Caucasian) of children age 2-6 with T1D (M age&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.86&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.13&#x000a0;yrs) completed baseline assessment of parent anxiety and depression and daily T1D management.</p><p id="__p2220">Using the STAI, 31% of parents scored over the clinical cutoff for symptoms of state anxiety and, on the CES-D, 21% of parents met criteria for mild (8%) or moderate (13%) depression. Anxiety and depression symptoms were not significantly associated with frequency of BG checks or BG variability; however, increased anxiety was associated with poorer parent-reported dietary adherence [F(4,55) = 10.09, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01, R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.38] and more frequent child snacks/meals [F(2,57) = 5.39, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01, R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.13]. Controlling for marital status, education, and income, higher levels of anxiety were associated with poorer metabolic control (A1c) in children [F(4, 54) = 4.67, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01, R2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.20]. Depressive symptoms were not significantly related to A1c and the effect of anxiety on A1c remained with the inclusion of depression scores.</p><p id="__p2221">Parental anxiety appears to be a salient factor in T1D management in young children and treatment of parent anxiety may improve child health outcomes. The impact of anxiety on dietary management may be related to hypoglycemia fear and can provide a specific avenue for intervention. The direction of the relationship between anxiety and A1c is not presently known yet may be better understood with the completion of the RCT.</p><p id="__p2222">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Maureen Monaghan, PhD, Psychology, Children&#x02019;s National Medical Center, Washington, DC, 20037; maureen.monaghan@gmail.com</p><p id="__p2223">SS10b</p><p id="__p2224">MATERNAL DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND CHILDREN WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES</p><p id="__p2225">Kari L.

Further, research shows mothers are often primary care givers such that maternal psychological adjustment and its relation to children&#x02019;s disease care management are surprisingly understudied.</p><p id="__p2228">Baseline data were analyzed from 179 mothers of generally middle-class young adolescents with T1D in a multi-site RCT. Mothers completed questionnaires and were interviewed about family functioning and diabetes management. On average, mothers were 42&#x000a0;years old and completed 2&#x000a0;years of post secondary education. Half were employed full time outside the home and 25% had no outside work. On average, children were 12.9&#x000a0;years old (range 11&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years), were generally in fair metabolic control (HbA1c&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.7%) and had diabetes for about 5&#x000a0;years.</p><p id="__p2229">A significant portion, 23% of the sample, had clinically elevated (mild to severe) depressive symptoms. Mothers who endorsed depressive symptoms (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;41) were matched on SES and compared to nondepressed maternal caregivers. More mothers with depressive symptoms were employed full time (60%) and were single parents (35%) than others (46% and 22 %, respectively). No significant group differences were found in maternal age or education, child age, HbA1c, or disease onset age. However, mothers who endorsed clinically elevated symptoms also reported more fear of hypoglycemia and lower self-efficacy for diabetes tasks, although youths&#x02019; metabolic control did not differ between groups.</p><p id="__p2230">Mothers with higher depressive scores appear able to help their youth achieve comparable levels of metabolic control as those without significant symptoms. However, elevated depressive symptoms occurred more often in single mothers who worked full time suggesting these mothers may have less time for and help with disease care. As youths become more autonomous maternal fears of hypoglycemia may magnify and perceptions of self-efficacy may decline. Screening and identification of mothers with high depressive symptoms and referral for supportive counseling may help them cope better and help ensure long-term optimal youth disease care.</p><p id="__p2231">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Kari L.

Bivariate correlations indicated that maternal symptoms of anxiety were related to lower levels of observed child-centered behavior (displays of sensitivity) (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.50, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.005) and listener responsiveness (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.38, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.038), higher levels of antisocial behavior (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.54, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.002), and somewhat higher levels of hostility (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.33, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.073).

Although multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment has been shown to be effective in CWP and FM, on average effect sizes are small. One possible area of improvement is referring those patients for treatment in whom a clinically relevant treatment effect can be expected. To be able to do this, patient characteristics associated with treatment success need to be identified.</p><p id="__p2271">This presentation will first provide results from a systematic review of current literature on predictors of improvement following multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment. Four outcome domains were studied: pain, physical functioning, emotional functioning, and general improvement / quality of life. In general, the available evidence suggests that cognitive and emotional factors are predictive of treatment outcome. For both pain and physical functioning, poor treatment outcome was predicted by the presence of emotional problems, interpersonal distress, and depression. Apart from these cognitive and emotional factors, evidence for baseline pain intensity and impact of pain as predictors of treatment outcome were found.</p><p id="__p2272">Additionally, data will be presented from a prospective cohort study on health outcomes in CWP and FM, for which analyses are currently in progress.</p><p id="__p2273">Based on the findings from the systematic review and prospective cohort study, pathways for successful rehabilitation treatment in CWP and FM will be discussed.</p><p id="__p2274">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Martijn Steultjens, PhD, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, 1007&#x000a0;MB; m.steultjens@vumc.nl</p><p id="__p2275">SS11c</p><p id="__p2276">USING AN INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL THERAPY APPROACH TO IMPROVE FUNCTION AND REDUCE DISTRESS IN PATIENTS WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN MANAGED IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE</p><p id="__p2277">Eva Denison, PhD</p><p id="__p2278"><sup>1</sup>Department of Evidence-Based Health Care, The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, Oslo, Norway and <sup>2</sup>Uppsala University, Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.</p><p id="__p2279">A majority of patients with musculoskeletal pain (MSP) are managed within primary health care (PHC). While physicians are involved in the initial assessment of patients&#x02019; problems, physical therapists typically carry out interventions to reduce pain and improve function. There is now ample evidence that psychosocial factors such as self-efficacy, fear of pain and/or movement/re-injury, catastrophizing, and social reinforcement contingencies contribute to the development of persistent pain and disability. In our research group at Uppsala University we have developed an integrated behavioral medicine and physical therapy treatment approach for patients with MSP that builds on basic motor and behavior learning principles and cognitive-behavioral principles. The approach comprises identification of problems and goals, monitoring of problems, functional behavioral analyses, basic and applied skills acquisition, generalization of skills, and relapse prevention. Evaluation of the approach involves clinical studies at both the individual level and group level and there are promising results at both short-term and long-term follow-up. Recent studies have focused on 1) targeting and tailoring of treatment based on screening of psychosocial factors and individual functional analyses, and 2) screening for psychosocial risk factors in telephone counseling. An emerging research area concerns implementation of the integrated approach in general clinical practice within PHC. Pilot work in our research group indicates that physical therapists may have greater difficulties in adopting this integrated approach than anticipated, lack of theoretical knowledge being one possible explanation. Further implementation efforts involve research as well as systematic integration of the approach in physical therapy curricula, the latter being done at two Swedish universities.</p><p id="__p2280">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Eva Denison, PhD, Department of Evidence-Based Health Care, The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, Oslo, N-0130; eva.denison@kunnskapssenteret.no</p><p id="__p2281">SS11d</p><p id="__p2282">HYPERVIGILANCE AND ATTENTIONAL BIAS IN CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS: QUO VADIS?</p><p id="__p2283">Geert Crombez, PhD</p><p id="__p2284">Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Gent, Belgium.</p><p id="__p2285">Hypervigilance to pain and attentional bias are considered as key processes in understanding chronic pain, distress and suffering (Crombez et al., 2005; Pincus &#x00026; Morley, 2001; Vlaeyen et al., 1995). Results are however contradictory. We performed a meta-analysis of attentional bias to pain-related information to address this issue, and in particular to investigate the role of pain-related fear, anxiety (trait and state) and depressive mood upon attentional bias to pain.</p><p id="__p2286">Method: 61 studies (2739 participants) were identified using an emotional stroop paradigm, dot probe paradigm and exogeneous cueing paradigm. We coded methodological quality (internal and external), sample characteristics (chronic pain, experimental pain, procedural pain), and procedural characteristics. We obtained the original full dataset (80% response rate) to analyze the effects of our theory-based moderators.</p><p id="__p2287">Results: The methodological quality of studies varied widely and is on average of moderate quality. Initial analyses revealed a significant attentional bias to pain-related information for whom pain was a current concern (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.127) in comparison with a control group (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025). The effect was significant for the chronic pain group, the experimental pain group and the procedural pain group. Further analyses revealed that the attentional bias to sensory pain words was signficant, but not to affective pain words, stimuli related to antecedents of pain (e.g. injury or blood) or to stimuli related to consequences of pain (e.g. wheelchair). We are currently performing the moderator analysis focusing upon the role of pain-related fear, anxiety and depressive mood.</p><p id="__p2288">In conclusion, the methodological quality of attentional bias studies is moderate and can be improved. An attentional bias to sensory pain words exist in those who are concerned about pain. The implications for future research and for understandings of chronic pain, distress and suffering will be discussed.</p><p id="__p2289">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Geert Crombez, PhD, Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Gent, 9000; geert.crombez@ugent.be</p><p id="__p2290">SS33</p><p id="__p2291">IVR ASSESSMENT AND BRIEF INTERVENTION CONCERNING HAZARDOUS AND HARMFUL ALCOHOL USE</p><p id="__p2292">Anne H Berman, PhD</p><p id="__p2293">Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.</p><p id="__p2294">Risky use of alcohol is a serious public health problem in Sweden and the U.S., as well as other countries. Despite organized efforts to screen for risky use, only a small proportion of individuals with hazardous and harmful use are screened, and an even smaller proportion receive appropriate tailored help to eliminate risky alcohol use and improve their quality of life. Research on automated telephonic screening and intervention in the form of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) among primary care patients, students, and other risk groups in the population, suggests that this technology could make a significant contribution towards increasing awareness of risky alcohol use among individuals that are otherwise difficult to reach.

Earlier response rates have ranged from 80% to 74.5%. Hazardous alcohol consumption has ranged between 13.2 and 15.1% and harmful alcohol consumption has been identified for 2.6 to 2.9%. Hazardous and harmful drug consumption was identified at 3.1%.</p><p id="__p2301">The increasing general availability and accessibility of information and communication technologies (ICT) over the past decade has made the use of IVR and the Internet in such studies a natural continuing step to take. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of IVR and Internet modes of administration in a population survey and to assess psychometric robustness.</p><p id="__p2302">Methods: A random population sample of 5000 individuals 16-80&#x000a0;years old was extracted from the Swedish Population Registry. Two thousand individuals were invited to participate via IVR, 2000 via the Internet, and 1000 individuals were offered a choice between IVR and Internet administration. Individuals indicating risky alcohol and drug use were followed up 12&#x000a0;months later using the same administration method.</p><p id="__p2303">Results: The overall response rate was 37.6%, via the Internet it was 37.8% and via IVR 33.8%. The Internet-IVR choice group had a response rate of 46.2% to 43%, higher when the Internet was the first alternative listed. Hazardous or harmful alcohol use was indicated by 20.7% with hazardous or harmful drug use at 2.8%. Cronbach &#x003b1; coefficients &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80 for the Internet version of the AUDIT and &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77 for the IVR version.

Helzer, MD</p><p id="__p2309">Health Behavior Research Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT.</p><p id="__p2310">Objectives: Our research team is testing the clinical potential of Interactive Voice Response. IVR is a simple, automated technology usable anywhere touch-tone phones are available. We have previously shown that IVR can ascertain valid clinical information, convey information to patients, and enhance interventions. We are currently testing IVR as a method for alcohol screening and delivering an automated Brief Alcohol Intervention (BI) in primary care offices.</p><p id="__p2311">Methods: We implemented an IVR system to do a brief screening questionnaire when patients arrive at the clinic for their appointment. The screen includes the AUDIT-C and general health questions. It requires less than one minute to complete; results are printed immediately for review by the provider and discussion with the patient. Patients who screen positive for at risk drinking are offered an IVR-based BI.</p><p id="__p2312">Results: Clinic arrivals (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;122) were invited at random to do the IVR-Screen using a touch-tone phone in the waiting room, 98% consented. No patient hung up during the screening interview; nearly all expressed satisfaction with the method and question items. Patients and physicians found IVR to be a useful means of screening. Of those screened, 16% were identified as candidates for an alcohol BI. Of these, 72% agreed to do the IVR-BI and 91% of those who initiated the IVR-BI completed it. The mean duration of the IVR-BI was 5 minutes; no caller felt this was too long and 68% said it increased their awareness of how heavily they drink. No patient expressed discomfort with the IVR-BI; only 5% expressed any kind of negative reaction.</p><p id="__p2313">Conclusions: It is well established that alcohol SBI in primary care clinics is an effective intervention. However providers are reluctant to do SBI because of time constraints and other impediments. This study has demonstrated that IVR-based screening and brief intervention are both feasible and acceptable to patients and providers in a primary care setting. We are currently seeking funding to test the efficacy of an IVR- BI in primary care settings.</p><p id="__p2314">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anne H Berman, PhD, Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, S-14104; anne.h.berman@ki.se</p><p id="__p2315">SS33c</p><p id="__p2316">USING INTERACTIVE VOICE RESPONSE (IVR) TO TREAT PROBLEM DRINKERS IN THE COMMUNITY</p><p id="__p2317">Amy Rubin, PhD</p><p id="__p2318">Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.</p><p id="__p2319">Objectives: People who drink in a problematic or risky manner comprise a larger group than people who are alcohol dependent, yet treatment for problem drinkers is much less prevalent in the U.S. Using technological solutions to bring interventions to problem drinkers promises to make appropriate treatment options more widely available.

The SARS outbreak in 2003 infected more than 8000 people worldwide and killed almost 800 people (WHO, 2003). SARS is an unusual and contagious form of pneumonia, caused by a novel strain of the corona-virus (Peiris et al, 2003). Compared to research available on the biological or physical effects of SARS, there are relatively few published articles on the psychosocial impact of SARS and, to our knowledge, no follow-up studies exist beyond 18&#x000a0;months. The present study examined the early and long-term psychological effects of SARS on patients who received treatment at a rehab hospital in Toronto after contracting the illness in 2003. Method: 40 post-SARS patients completed measures pertaining to their level of well-being and psychological and physical health. Patients completed questionnaires first in 2004, shortly after recovery from the acute phase of SARS, and again in 2007. Results/Conclusion: Our findings indicated that well-being, general health, mental health, and vitality significantly deteriorated (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) from 2004 to 2007 in a large portion of the sample. Follow up study showed that, 87.5% of the sample population fell below average levels on measures of general health (based on the SF-36) in 2007 as compared to 48.6% in 2007. Symptoms of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress persisted or intensified in a significant portion of post-SARS patients (32.5% to 57.5%) 4&#x000a0;years after infection. This apparent persistence or elevation in emotional distress among SARS survivors was both unexpected and concerning. Since patients had seemingly recovered from the acute phase of the illness, one would have expected a decrease in their level of psychological distress over time. A closer look at the relationship between the examined variables may provide further insight as to the underlying causes of patients&#x02019; persistent symptoms. Regardless of the cause, as it currently stands, SARS appears to be a chronic illness.</p><p id="__p2342">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Parvaneh Moallef, MA, York University, Thornhill, ON, L4J 0C1; pmoallef@sympatico.ca</p><p id="__p2343">2:48&#x000a0;PM-3:06&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p2344">OS13-C</p><p id="__p2345">FACTORS INFLUENCE THE UPTAKE OF 2009 H1N1 INFLUENZA VACCINE IN A MULTIETHNIC ASIAN POPULATION</p><p id="__p2346">Li-Ping Wong, MSc, PhD<sup>1</sup> and I-Ching Sam, MRCP, MRCPath<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p2347"><sup>1</sup>Medical Education &#x00026; Research Development Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and <sup>2</sup>Tropical Infectious Diseases Research and Education Centre, Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaya,, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p><p id="__p2348">Background: It has been shown that early vaccination against 2009 H1N1 influenza is cost-effective and may avert more deaths. Thus, whether or not public agree to be vaccinated is a crucial factor in controlling the 2009 H1N1 influenza. To increase influenza vaccination rates, it is important to understand the motivators and barriers to vaccination. As the 2009 H1N1 influenza was previously referred to as &#x0201c;swine flu&#x0201d;, it is not know how the Muslim community would react to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine as the name might lead to the perception that the vaccine may contain animal parts that may not be &#x02018;halal&#x02019; (kosher) or unfit for Muslims to use. This study assessed a predominantly Muslim, multiethnic Malaysian community&#x02019; attitudes toward the H1N1 influenza immunization. The aim of this study was to determine factors influence the uptake of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine in a multiethnic Asian population.</p><p id="__p2349">Methods: Cross-sectional, computer-assisted telephone interview.

Participants who indicated positive intention to vaccinate against 2009 H1N1 influenza were more likely to have favorable attitudes toward the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. The vast majority of Malay participants (95.1%) were of the opinion that the H1N1 vaccine must be kosher for them to consume. Additionally, weather the vaccine was kosher was noted the main factor that determine Malay participants&#x02019; decision to vaccination, whereas safety of the vaccine was the main factor that influenced vaccination decision for both the Chinese and Indian participants. Study identified sociodemographic variables and psychological impact (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.23, P &#x0003c;0.001) as significant predictors for intention to vaccination.</p><p id="__p2351">Conclusion: Study highlights the challenges in promoting the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Findings suggest that ethnic-sensitive efforts may be needed to reach out to and gain acceptance of H1N1 vaccine in country with diverse ethnic communities and religious practices. Health authorities and public media need to initiate considerable amount of psychological impact of the H1N1 pandemic to the public to enhance vaccine acceptance.</p><p id="__p2352">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Li-Ping Wong, MSc, PhD, Medical Education &#x00026; Researc Development Unit, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, 50603; wonglp@ummc.edu.my</p><p id="__p2353">3:06&#x000a0;PM-3:24&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p2354">OS13-D</p><p id="__p2355">CHANGES IN ANXIETY AND INFORMATION SEEKING FOLLOWING THE H1N1 OUTBREAK: AN ANALYSIS OF WEB BLOGS AND WIKIPEDIA VISITS</p><p id="__p2356">Kate Faasse, MSc (Health Psych),<sup>1</sup> Yla R.

Web-based information-seeking behaviour was examined using the pattern of visits to H1N1-related Wikipedia pages from two weeks before to two weeks after the outbreak was announced. The relationship between information seeking and anxiety word use in web blogs was also investigated.</p><p id="__p2360">Results: Blogs mentioning &#x0201c;swine flu&#x0201d; contained significantly higher levels of anxiety, health and death-related words, and lower levels of positive emotion words that control blogs. Use of anxiety words decreased steadily over the two week study period following the announcement of the H1N1 outbreak. The peak in Wikipedia visits to H1N1-related pages was three days after the peak in anxiety word use measured in web blogs.

There are, however, several indications that part of PC is unconscious and may be responsible for a considerable part of daily prolonged physiological activity. For example, worry itself appears to be associated with prolonged physiological effects, both during nocturnal sleep and in daily life, up to two hours after worry episodes. The existence of unconscious PC (UPC) is likely because most cognitive processes are (partly or entirely) unconscious. Moreover, several studies using subliminal (under awareness threshold) negative emotional stimuli suggest that unconscious emotional cognition increase amongst others amygdala activity and skin conductance level. We hypothesized that subliminal negative stimuli also increase more substantial, health-related parameters such as blood pressure. Showing this would imply crucial support for the notion that UPC can have health-relevant physiological effects.</p><p id="__p2381">Eighty college students anticipating an examination in the next two weeks, were shown either (1) subliminal negative words, such as &#x0201c;failure&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;stupid&#x0201d;, (2) subliminal neutral words, (3) supraliminal (above awareness threshold) negative words, or (4) neutral supraliminal words, during a neutral computer task. For subliminal stimulation as masking procedure was used. Blood pressure was measured continuously using a Portapres Model-2. An awareness check ascertained that no subject could consciously perceive the subliminal stimuli</p><p id="__p2382">Results indicated that while negative words decreased systolic blood pressure marginally significantly across awareness conditions (F(1,77)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.265, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.10), they did so clearly and significantly in the subliminal condition (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), but hardly and nonsignificantly in the subliminal condition. Diastolic effects were in the same direction but nonsignificant. High trait anxiety but not high trait worry augmented these differential effects of awareness of negative stimuli. The effects could not be explained by conscious PC or mood.</p><p id="__p2383">Concluding, the results suggest that unconscious but not (or to a lesser extent) conscious negative emotional information can increase blood pressure. This lends credibility to the hypothesis that unconscious emotional processing (UPC) may have physiological consequences, and warrants further studies, including real life studies, using available measures of unconscious emotion, to examine robustness and magnitude of similar effects in real life.</p><p id="__p2384">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jos F.

Little is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in mental stress (MS)-induced arrhythmias in coronary patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). T-wave alternans (TWA) is an established VVR marker. High levels of resting QT variability index (QTVI) and low levels of resting ejection fraction (EF) are other markers of increased arrhythmic risk. MS and Exercise (EX) differ in central and autonomic cardiac activation patterns. We hypothesized that ICD patients with high levels of TWA would have high levels of QTVI and lower levels of EF and that these linkages would be more pronounced during EX compared to MS. QTVI, TWA and EF were assessed at rest and TWA was also measured during MS (anger recall), and during bicycle ergometry in 43 ICD patients. HR rise during EX was higher than during MS (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). After adjusting for HR, TWA during EX was significantly greater than TWA during MS, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05. Resting QTVI was associated with TWA during MS (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.52, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01) and TWA during EX (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.48, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Similarly, EF was negatively associated with TWA during MS (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.43, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01) and EX (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.38, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). The strength of the associations between TWA and QTVI or EF did not differ between EX and MS, (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.8). These findings indicate that abnormalities in QTVI and EF at rest may identify similar augmentation of VVR as TWA during EX and MS in ICD patients. The similar influence of MS and EX on indices of VVR suggests that both stressors are potentially pro-arrhythmic, yet the performance characteristics of HR-adjusted TWA are different across the stressors, consistent with the different underlying physiology of the two challenge tasks.</p><p id="__p2391">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anna Ghambaryan, ms md, USUHS, Chevy Chase, MD, 20815; aghambaryan@usuhs.mil</p><p id="__p2392">3:06&#x000a0;PM-3:24&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p2393">OS14-C</p><p id="__p2394">25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D DEFICIENCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS: RESULTS FROM THE MULTI-ETHNIC STUDY OF ARTHEROSCLEROSIS (MESA)</p><p id="__p2395">Jonathan A.

Methods: MESA participants with low depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies&#x02014;Depression Scale (CES-D)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;408) or elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D&#x02009;&#x02267;&#x02009;10; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;244) but without chronic kidney disease had levels of 25(OH)D assessed. Potentially confounding (i.e., age, sex, race, income, education, body mass index, season of data acquisition, study site, amount of moderate and vigorous physical activity) and exploratory causal covariates were also measured (smoking within the past 30&#x000a0;days, self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol (mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein (mmol/L), systolic blood pressure (mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), and anti-depressant medication (tricyclic and non-tricyclic use). Results: Deficient levels of 25(OH)D (&#x0003c;15&#x000a0;ng/mL) were present in 24.7% and insufficient levels (&#x02267;15-&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;ng/mL) were present in 59.4% of participants.

Recovered persons may, however, display &#x0201c;biological vigilance,&#x0201d; or physiological reactions to trauma cues. We examined this using measures correlated with aging-related morbidity and mortality: circulating levels of C-reactive protein and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), along with stimulated IL-6 production. Apparently healthy, postmenopausal women with divorce histories completed interviews to assess current and lifetime PTSD in response to past intimate partner violence, or other traumatic events. Women, all without current syndromal PTSD, were classified by history of PTSD diagnosis: none (PTSD-; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;33), subthreshold (PTSD+s; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18), or syndromal (PTSD+; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12). Women attended two research visits; for each, a blood draw was followed by questionnaires that were either benign (Baseline Visit 1), or trauma- and PTSD-related, plus a diagnostic interview (Visit 2 Trauma Assessment). Mixed effects models tested effects for PTSD History, Visit, and the PTSD History x Visit interaction. For circulating IL-6 levels only, there was a trend for a PTSD History x Visit interaction, F(2,59.4) = 2.89, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.06. Interleukin-6 responses to the two visits differed for PTSD- and PTSD+ women (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03). For PTSD- women, IL-6 levels were higher at Baseline than Trauma Assessment (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05). In contrast, for PTSD+ women, IL-6 levels were higher at Trauma Assessment than Baseline, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.16). Further, at Baseline only, there was a trend (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.06) for lower IL-6 levels among PTSD+ and PTSD+ s women, compared to PTSD- women. These preliminary results, limited by sample size, require replication. Tentatively, however, the pattern suggests that women with past syndromal PTSD may be characterized by baseline IL-6 hypoarousal, along with plasma IL-6 increases in anticipation of confronting trauma reminders.

The basic information for this study was obtained from official sources; trends of homicide rates by age groups 15-24 and 25-34 between 1979 and 2007 were analyzed; for each Mexican state, homicide rates by each age groups analyzed in triennial 2005-2007 were calculated; through the use of multiple regression analysis (stepwise method) the variables that better explained the interstate variations in the homicide rates were identified. The results show that the homicide rate in both age groups have diminished in last 30&#x000a0;years, however these rates are relatively high in the international context. Furthermore, although the male homicide rates are clearly higher in both age groups, this excess of male mortality has been notoriously reduced. Moreover impunity, drug trafficking, social exclusion and firearms possession are key elements to understand the geographic variations of the youth homicide mortality in Mexico in the analyzed triennial. In particular, drug trafficking has a great importance to analyze the variations of the homicide rate in 25-34&#x000a0;years old group. The found regression model equations explain more of 50% of the geographic variations of the homicide rate in both age groups. In this context, findings suggest that if Mexican government wants to reduce the geographical disparities in youth homicide rates, needs to develop new strategies to combat drug trafficking, establish programs to restrict firearm possession, and implement structural reforms to reduce poverty, social marginalization and socioeconomic disparities among states.</p><p id="__p2423">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Guillermo J.

This is a cross-sectional, analytic type study. The data were gathered by questionnaire applied to 661 students enrolled in public high schools, during the period from December of 2008 to June of 2009. In the sample selection approach - random and multi-stage - it was considered the entirety of state&#x02019;s high schools of the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, Mexico.</p><p id="__p2430">According to obtained data, 48% of students were involved in some kind of violent event; 25% as victims, and 15% within a double role: eventually either as victim or aggressor, it was found that 8 out of 100 students were aggressors.

In the multivariate analysis for both genders, three are the variables that better explain aggressor&#x02019;s status: gender (OR 1.8), to be victimized for the family (OR 2.6) and to be involved in situations that unchain a police detention (OR 3). Conclusion: Before entering school the adolescent has blended a series of family experiences (interfamilial violence) and peer relationships (participation in gangs exhibiting criminal records) -that allow to forecast what could be the way of relating with schoolmates. Although the school becomes the new scenario where the adolescent has the opportunity to play a role already learned, in turn, this could become the field where the necessary transformation of risk behaviors and/or the learning of styles for social affront are mediated.</p><p id="__p2431">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Maria G.

Such emerging violence amidst rising prosperity in Malaysia is posing serious challenges to behavioural medicine and healthcare.</p><p id="__p2466">In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 purposively sampled young respondents from 12 low-cost housing neighbourhoods within Kuala Lumpur to explore their perceptions and experiences of violence, and health impact.</p><p id="__p2467">The 25 multi-ethnic respondents, (12 men and 13 women) aged between 18-25&#x000a0;years, were residents of public low-cost high density housing where neighbourhood violence, viz. vandalism, street fights, robbery, drug dealing and homicide, was common. Perceptions of violence were varied and gender differentiated. Men tended to perceive crime as violence and serious violence to involve bleeding, hospitalization or death. Women regarded fights, injuring others and crime as violence and ranked murder and rape to be serious violence. Women and men were reluctant to intervene in domestic violence because they perceived it as a private matter although several respondents felt that a husband has no right to beat his wife. Men, more than women, had direct experience with violence. Some men had been robbed, threatened and beaten. Several men had perpetrated violence: selling drugs during teen years, involved in illegal motorcycle racing, and assaulting a neighbour. A couple of women had been robbed. None had suffered any physical injuries/disability due to violence or reported symptoms of severe psychological consequences viz. disturbed sleep, appetite and moods. Yet, women were more affected by high anxiety and pervasive fear of being victims of crime. Men were more concerned about safety of their families, especially female members. Girl child kidnapping, rape and murder happening in and around the neighbourhoods had created secondary traumatisation and strong sense of vulnerability to such violence among women.

In the Health under Construction Study, 27 occupational health professionals (counselors) performed a six-month motivational interviewing-based lifestyle intervention for construction workers. The intervention was aimed at changing dietary, physical activity, and smoking behavior, and thereby lowering cardiovascular disease risk. The purpose of this process evaluation was to evaluate the counselors&#x02019; adherence to the intervention protocol, their competence, and the associations between adherence, competence and body weight at follow up.</p><p id="__p2477">Methods: The number of sessions and prescribed items discussed in the first counseling session were registered by the counselors. Counselors&#x02019; competence in listening, supporting, motivating, and informing was rated by both participants and counselors. Adherence to motivational interviewing was determined by expert scoring of 19 audio-taped fragments. Associations between reach, dose, and competence, and body weight at follow-up were determined by linear regression analyses.</p><p id="__p2478">Results: Two-thirds of all participants attended five or more sessions, and 38.5% attended all seven sessions. In 90.2% of all cases, the counselor discussed all four prescribed items in the first session. Adherence to motivational interviewing was concluded from only one audio-taped fragment. 86.3 percent of all participants agreed with the counselor being competent. Neither counselors&#x02019; competence, nor number of sessions or items discussed, was significantly associated with body weight loss.</p><p id="__p2479">Conclusions: Performing five sessions and discussing four prescribed items was feasible for the counselors, whereas adhering to motivational interviewing was not. Still, participants were positive about the counselors&#x02019; competence and willing to attend the counseling sessions. Investigators are encouraged to report the evaluation of their intervention process, in order to improve future lifestyle interventions in research or in practice.</p><p id="__p2480">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Iris Groeneveld, MSc, Public and Occupational Health, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, 1081 BT; iris.groeneveld@vumc.nl</p><p id="__p2481">2:48&#x000a0;PM-3:06&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p2482">OS16-B</p><p id="__p2483">EFFICACY OF A SPIRITUALLY-BASED INTERVENTION TO INCREASE COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS AND SCREENING IN AFRICAN AMERICAN CHURCHES</p><p id="__p2484">Cheryl L.

Community-based approaches have grown in popularity, in an effort to fight these cancer disparities. Though church-based approaches have been included among these initiatives, few are &#x0201c;spiritually-based&#x0201d; in nature, using spiritual/religious themes and writings to support the core health message. Such an approach may increase the cultural relevance of a health communication, and perhaps even its efficacy. The efficacy of a Community Health Advisor-led intervention to increase awareness and screening for colorectal cancer was examined using a randomized controlled trial, in which a spiritually-based approach was compared against a non-spiritual (e.g., secular) comparison intervention of same structure and content. Trained Community Health Advisors led two educational sessions on colorectal cancer. Study participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;358) completed baseline, 1-month, and 12-month follow-up surveys. A 90% retention rate was achieved over the course of the study period. Within group analyses suggest that the spiritually-based intervention resulted in significant increases from baseline to one-month follow-up in colorectal cancer knowledge (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), perceived benefits to screening (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), and significant decreases in perceived barriers to screening (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Comparisons between the spiritually-based and non-spiritual intervention indicate that the spiritually-based intervention was more efficacious than the non-spiritual for increasing perceived benefits to screening (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), while the non-spiritual was more effective for increasing knowledge (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Data are also examined among demographic subgroups such as men and women. Screening data at the 12-month follow-up are also reported. These findings suggest that the spiritually-based and non-spiritual approaches to health communication may have different impacts depending on the outcome and demographic subgroup being examined.</p><p id="__p2487">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Cheryl L.

The aim of this study was to examine how these user reactions might be linked to users&#x02019; engagement with five specific design features of the &#x02018;Internet Doctor&#x02019;, an Internet-based intervention to promote the self-care of cold and &#x02018;flu symptoms. The five design features were: social context and support; visual appearance; credibility; tailoring; and usability. Twenty six adults aged 18 to 63 participated in &#x02018;think-aloud&#x02019; interviews. Inductive thematic analysis and techniques from grounded theory were used to identify recurring patterns within the data. Three user reactions were identified: users&#x02019; trust of the &#x02018;Internet Doctor&#x02019;; users&#x02019; anthropomorphic responses to the &#x02018;Internet Doctor&#x02019;; and users&#x02019; preference for human involvement in their healthcare. These reactions appeared to be linked to differences in user engagement with four of the five design features (social context and support; visual appearance; credibility; and tailoring). For example, some users who trusted the &#x02018;Internet Doctor&#x02019; expressed positive views of social context and support features (e.g. a question and answer format that was analogous to face-to-face dialogue; information about the &#x02018;real&#x02019; doctor behind the advice) - using them as justification to trust the website&#x02019;s diagnosis and advice. In contrast, participants who expressed a desire for human interaction and were aware of their own anthropomorphic responses to the &#x02018;Internet Doctor&#x02019; were uneasy about features that provided social context and support. Different user reactions were hence associated with different types of engagement with the same design feature. The implications of these findings for the optimal design of Internet-based health behaviour interventions will be discussed.</p><p id="__p2516">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Leanne G.

Unhealthy behaviour, and especially alcohol consumption, has been considered a source of accidents and injuries among construction workers. However, unhealthy behaviour can also be seen as a result of the safety and risk conditions of these jobs.</p><p id="__p2546">Methods: The purpose of this paper is to contrast the role of unhealthy behaviour as a source or as an outcome of safety and risk in the industrial sector. Data was collected from 180 workers belonging to a Industrial and construction company. Two path models representing these two hypotheses were tested. The model in which unhealthy behaviour is an antecedent of injuries did not fit the data (Chi square&#x02009;=&#x02009;73.798, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).</p><p id="__p2547">Results: It supports the hypothesis of unhealthy behaviour as a result of safety and risk factors through the mediating effect of the experience of tension (Chi-square&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.507, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.212).

Studies have examined the relationship between single bouts of unemployment and psychological well-being as well as single and multiple bouts of unemployment with life satisfaction. This study examines the effect of multiple bouts of unemployment on psychological well-being. Specifically, whether people became sensitized, i.e. Psychological well-being becomes worse with each bout of unemployment, or adapted, i.e. Psychological well-being is worst with the first bout of unemployment and the impact of each additional period of unemployment is less than the first. Data came from the British Household Panel Survey, a large-scale longitudinal representative panel study. Psychological well-being was measured using the GHQ and participation in the labour force was self-reported; data were examined separately for males and females using multilevel modelling. The GHQ score at the first unemployment bout was used as the reference category. These scores were compared to scores from the period previous to the first unemployment bout, and at subsequent unemployment and re-employment bouts. Up to three unemployment and re-employment periods were allowed per individual.</p><p id="__p2565">Results show that there are definite gender differences in reactions to unemployment. Among males and females, psychological well-being worsened significantly during the period up to the first unemployment bout (difference scores 0.89, p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001 and 0.90, p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001 for males and females, respectively). Psychological well-being significantly improved during the first re-employment stage for both males and females (difference scores 0.95, p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001 and 1.04, p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001 for males and females, respectively). Psychological well-being scores were significantly lower for the second unemployment bout compared to the first for males (0.74, p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) but not for females (0.02, p-value&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). A test for linear trend was significant for both males and females; however differences between reactions became smaller with each unemployment period for males, but larger for females.</p><p id="__p2566">There were differences in response to multiple bouts of unemployment between males and females in this study. Males experienced adaptation in that the response to the first bout of unemployment was significantly greater than the response to subsequent bouts (trend test p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Females, however, experienced sensitization in that response increased with each bout of unemployment (trend test p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). The findings suggest that males are able to adjust to multiple unemployment bouts while females&#x02019; psychological well-being becomes worse.</p><p id="__p2567">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Cara L.

Staff training is an essential element for organisations wishing to achieve the evidence based UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI) and since it is known that those who volunteer for training are often the most competent, an objective training needs analysis is required. A breastfeeding training programme is being delivered to healthcare staff in the West Midlands, UK. Prior to the training staff undertake an online objective evaluation of their breastfeeding knowledge.</p><p id="__p2584">Objective: To assess the levels of breastfeeding knowledge of healthcare staff working with mothers in England. To assess if training needs differed according to prior recent training in breastfeeding, years of service, and profession.</p><p id="__p2585">Methods: Breastfeeding knowledge was measured before the training programme was undertaken. A web based assessment tool Coventry University Breastfeeding Assessment (CUBA) was used to assess healthcare staff in eight sub scales relating to breastfeeding knowledge and practice.</p><p id="__p2586">Results: 248 healthcare staff completed the online assessment. Overall, knowledge levels in relation to the sub scale breastfeeding difficulties and positioning and attachment were highest with 93.1% and 95.2% respectively achieving 50% or higher. Knowledge of who breastfeeds and the challenges to breastfeeding scored the lowest with 54.5% and 46.4% respectively scoring less than 50%. In six out of the eight categories 30% or more staff scored less than 50%. T tests showed scores relating to positioning and attachment, difficulties, challenges, support and total scores were significantly higher for those who had received training within the last year whereas no differences were found by length of service. Midwives had significantly higher mean scores for supporting breastfeeding and practices compared to health visitors.</p><p id="__p2587">Conclusions: These results indicate clear gaps in the knowledge levels of healthcare staff in the West Midlands of England. Knowledge levels vary across the eight subscales and it is possible to identify clearly the areas where further training is required. A training programme is being implemented to address these needs.</p><p id="__p2588">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Louise Wallace, PhD C Psychol, Coventry University, Coventry, CV1 5FB; hsx201@coventry.ac.uk</p><p id="__p2589">PST-101b</p><p id="__p2590">MEASURING THE EFFICIENCY OF PRIMARY CARE/MENTAL HEALTH INTEGRATION WITHIN PRIMARY CARE AND THE IMPACT ON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH UTILIZATION</p><p id="__p2591">Sarah L.

Over the past three years, MH/PC integration has received unprecedented support within Veterans Affairs. This poster will detail how collaboration among primary care and mental health services at one VA has evolved into a successful integration program. The presentation/poster will include information about co-location, integration, and open-access as well as data regarding efficacy and model fidelity. Quantitative data will be presented regarding our universal suicide/homicide risk screening practice in primary care, our substance use co-integration initiative, and our integration project to address diabetes, HTN, and dyslipidemia. Qualitative data addressing primary care staff satisfaction with the program will also be presented. Four indicators of efficiency will be offered: (1) promptness of mental-health consultant availability, (2) market penetration (i.e., what percentage of patients seen are new patients), (3) brief visits to ensure rapid availability, and (4) efficient/cost-effective utilization of specialty mental health resources (e.g., psychiatry, psychology, social-work clinics). With regard to efficiency/cost-effectiveness, an integration program is considered more effective when more mild-moderate cases are treated in primary care, fewer referrals are sent to specialty mental health care and a greater proportion of specialty referrals are completed. These efficiency/cost-effectiveness markers offer an indication of whether a patient was appropriately triaged within primary care.</p><p id="__p2594">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: David Buyck, PhD, Mental Health Integration, VAMC Salem, Salem, VA, 24153; david.buyck@va.gov\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583831046816" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figs_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figs_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figs_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583831046816" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p2595">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Olli Kiviruusu, MSocSc, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, 00271; olli.kiviruusu@thl.fi\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583831044416" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figt_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figt_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figt_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583831044416" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p2596">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Susana M.

The first aim of this study was to examine the combined effect of social class and perceived stress on medicine use for headache among 25-44&#x000a0;year old men and women. The second aim of this study was to examine if sense of coherence (SOC) modifies the effect of social class and stress on medicine use for headache.</p><p id="__p2602">Methods: National cross-sectional study in Denmark. The study population consisted of men and women aged 25-44, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;955. The survey was conducted by using web-based questionnaires and telephone interviews. The outcome measure was medicine use for headache within the past 14&#x000a0;days. The independent variables were perceived stress, social class and SOC.

We assessed depression as a correlate of SM.</p><p id="__p2611">Background: T2DM is the leading cause of CKD, a pre-dialysis, staged kidney disorder. 20-40% of adults with T2DM progress to CKD. Silent symptoms typify early CKD stages making their self-management needs less obvious. It is known that T2DM regimen adherence may forestall glomerular damage, thereby slowing or even halting progression to kidney failure. 30-40% of patients with diabetes report elevated depressive symptoms. T2DM-CKD stressors associated with elevated depression rates include complications with treatment additions, poor glycemic control, and insulin use. Depression interferes with self-management behaviors.</p><p id="__p2612">Methods: In this IRB-approved study, convenience sampling was used and subjects were enrolled from medical outpatient clinics. N&#x02009;=&#x02009;29 completed measures. Inclusion criteria entailed: (1) T2DM, (2) 18 to 85&#x000a0;years, and (3) stage 3 CKD based on eGFR calculation. Beck&#x02019;s Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) survey were completed. A BDI cut score of &#x02265;13 defined depression. Using SPSS v. 17, descriptive analyses of the sample and surveys were performed. Pearson R correlations were conducted to examine depression as a correlate of SM.</p><p id="__p2613">Results: These clinic-experienced subjects included 23 men and 6 women. The mean age was 65.6&#x000a0;years (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.8; Mdn&#x02009;=&#x02009;69.0) with 11 minority and 17 non-minority subjects. The mean education level was 13.8&#x000a0;years (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.1; Mdn&#x02009;=&#x02009;14). The mean HbA1c was 6.5 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1). Most subjects (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) had minimal to no depression, while three scored as mild to moderate. The BDI total mean was 6.46 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.3) with symptoms of energy loss, sleep pattern change, and tiredness/fatigue most often reported. SM behaviors performed less often were exercise, physical activity, eating vegetables, and blood sugar checks. BDI total score correlated significantly with feet checking (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.53, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.004).

Surgery to remove the bladder is the standard therapy when bladder cancer is muscle-invasive. Removal of the bladder necessitates the diversion of urine following three reconstructive techniques. Although all types of urinary diversions offer similar recurrence-free survival rates, the three procedures can have significantly different effects on a patient&#x02019;s urinary and sexual functioning, social activities, and body-image. The present study explored BL Ca treatment side effects and difficulties in health care among patients treated for invasive bladder cancer.</p><p id="__p2621">Materials and Methods: Tape-recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight patients treated with invasive bladder cancer (50% women). Patients were on average 61.5&#x000a0;years of age and 2&#x000a0;years and 5&#x000a0;months post diagnosis and treatment. Three patients have illial conduit, one patient has continent reservoir, and 4 patients have neobladder. The interviews focused on: a) patients&#x02019; understanding of invasive bladder cancer and treatment options; b) treatment side effects, social and psychological impact of treatment and side effects, and problems patients have/had with stoma and neobladder care following treatment.</p><p id="__p2622">Results: All patients reported having very little knowledge about treatment side effects and did not know what to expect after surgery. Four patients (50%) followed their physicians&#x02019; treatment recommendations and three patients (37.5%) indicated that only one treatment option was discussed and recommended. Before treatment, all patients with neobladder and continent reservoir did not know how to empty the pouch or use a catheter. The three patients with ileal conduit reported difficulty using stoma appliances following treatment.</p><p id="__p2623">Conclusions: Invasive bladder cancer patients lack full information of treatment side effects and less likely to be prepared for stoma and neobladder care. Results emphasize the need for educational interventions to help patients cope with treatment side effect and improve post-treatment health care.</p><p id="__p2624">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Nihal E.

Stigma of both diseases is influenced by attitudes toward homosexuality, conservatism and traditional gender roles. The results of social stigma can be experienced at an individual level such as isolation, at the level of family, as well as community and society levels. Allocation of resources can be affected by stigma, thus reducing care available for people with stigmatized illnesses. This study surveyed participants on attitude toward people with chronic illness, homosexuality, conservatism and interaction styles. Five hypotheses examined factors affecting stigma toward people with AIDS as compared to people with lung cancer. Data were collected in survey form and analyzed. Results indicate that, within the study sample, AIDS was not as stigmatized as lung cancer, though disease in general remains stigmatized. Variables such as negative attitude toward homosexuality, conservatism, and willingness to interact with people contributed to attitude toward people with AIDS or lung cancer.</p><p id="__p2630">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lauren N.

The purpose of this study was to investigate linguistic markers of depressed mood and positive treatment response to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for depression. Fifty partially remitted depressed individuals were randomly assigned an 8-week MBCT or control condition. Before and after treatment, participants rated 27 photographs (9 neutral, 9 positive, 9 negative) from the International Affective Picture System (Lang, Bradley and Cuthbert ,1999) on dimensions of valence and arousal. Following a delay, participants were asked to recall as much detail as possible for each photo. Verbatim responses were analyzed with LIWC2007 for 5 categories of depression-related content (positive emotion, negative emotion, sex, appetite, and death). Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI: Beck &#x00026; Steer, 1987) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown and Ryan, 2003) before and after treatment phase completion. At baseline, only words related to appetite were related to depression scores, while emotion, sex and death-related word use were uncorrelated. Use of appetite words were negatively associated with BDI scores (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.32, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02) so that the actively depressed used less appetite words than those in remission (BDI&#x0003c;10), [t(50) = 1.8 p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01]. BDI scores decreased significantly more in the MBCT group than controls [F(1,43) = 9.3, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.004, d&#x02009;=&#x02009;.89], and improvements in depression were associated with increased appetite word use (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.54, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.006). MAAS mindfulness scores increased more in the MBCT group than controls [F(1, 43) = 8.6, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001, d&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.02] and increases in appetite word use was associated with increases in mindfulness scores (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.41, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05). Results from this study suggest that spontaneous use of appetite-related words in response to photographs may be a sensitive indicator of the appetitive deficits that characterize depression.</p><p id="__p2636">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Maria Capecelatro, BS, Brown University, Providence, RI, 02912; maria.capecelatro@gmail.com</p><p id="__p2637">PST-109</p><p id="__p2638">AGE INFLUENCES ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS AMONG PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE</p><p id="__p2639">Risa N.

Emery, PhD</p><p id="__p2640">Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.</p><p id="__p2641">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Physical impairment in COPD may contribute to reduced health-related quality of life (QoL). Increased symptoms of anxiety and depression among patients with COPD also may lead to reduced QoL (Di Marco et al., 2006). In addition, prior research has indicated that illness perceptions, specifically increased awareness of illness symptoms and greater perceived consequences, are associated with poorer QoL (Scharloo et al., 2007); and research suggests that a patient&#x02019;s age may influence attributions that patients make about symptoms -- with older patients tending to attribute illness symptoms to aging (Leventhal &#x00026; Crouch, 1997). No prior studies have examined the relationship between age and illness perceptions among patients with COPD. The present study evaluated 75 COPD patients (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;63.24, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.37&#x000a0;years) upon entry into an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. All patients completed pulmonary function testing (FEV1, FVC), six-minute walk test, and self-report questionnaires, including the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ; Weinman, Petrie, Moss-Morris &#x00026; Horne, 1996). Data were analyzed with Pearson correlations. Results indicated that age was inversely associated with two dimensions of the IPQ, identity (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.24, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.0452) and consequences (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.44, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.0002). These associations remained significant after controlling for disease severity (FEV1). Thus, younger age was associated with increased attention to COPD symptoms and greater likelihood of attributing illness consequences to disease severity. These results suggest that beliefs regarding illness may be more salient among younger patients with COPD than among older patients who are likely to have had more time to adjust to the disease.</p><p id="__p2642">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Risa N.

Therefore, it is not surprising that patients report worse quality of life in both physical status and depression, anxiety and discomfort once being discharged from the unit (Garcia et al, 2003). Taking into account this fact and the importance of quality of life related to health, the aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in perception of quality of life reported by patients before and after admission to ICU. The study was based in 57 patients admitted to the ICU at General Hospital in Castell&#x000f3;n. Of these patients, 70.5% were male and 29.5% female, with a mean age of 53.6&#x000a0;years. From this study, we excluded people who had any communicating problem, and also people who suffer a prior psychological disorder. The participants, whilst staying in ICU and after giving their consent, were administered various questionnaires. One of them was the EuroQol in its Spanish version (Badia et al, 1999). The overall results show lower quality of life after admission to the unit (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.65, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00). When evaluating the dimensions separately, significant differences are observed in all of them (mobility, self care, ability to perform usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) for the total sample. When we analyzed the results by gender, we noticed differences before and after admission in all dimensions for men, whereas in women, no differences have been found in self care and anxiety/depression. Our results support findings in previous studies (Badia et al, 2008) suggesting that, although women have a worse quality of life before admission than men, these differences become smaller after the admission, showing a similar level of quality of life in both genders.</p><p id="__p2654">This work was supported by Spanish Ministry of Science and Education (PSI2008-01642/PSIC)</p><p id="__p2655">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Rafael Ballester Arnal, doctorate in psychology, Psicolog&#x000ed;a B&#x000e1;sica, Cl&#x000ed;nica y Psicobiolog&#x000ed;a, Universitat Jaume I, Castellon, 12071; gomezs@psb.uji.es</p><p id="__p2656">PST-112</p><p id="__p2657">CORRELATES OF ILLNESS BEHAVIOR IN SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS</p><p id="__p2658">Alexandra I.

Different studies of insight in schizophrenia have led to inconsistent findings and conflicting results alternatively stating that acknowledgement of one&#x02019;s mental illness is a detriment and a key to successful adaptation.</p><p id="__p2661">Objective: This cross-sectional study investigates the relationship between illness denial in schizophrenia and its influence on frequency of hospitalization and relapse, as well as the way insight relates to other important variables, such as depression, quality of life and optimism, patient&#x02019;s social context and available support system in Romania</p><p id="__p2662">Methods: All patients diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia (DSM-IV-R), and having a history of relapse and admitted in a six month period were asked to participate in the study. Patients who gave consent (45 patients) were evaluated using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ-18), The Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS),. Results to PANSS item G12 were used for the assessment of insight. Admission charts and interview were used for the assessment of social and familial support.</p><p id="__p2663">Results: The patients who had insight had also reduced optimism, a high rate of perceived stress, these being associated with a high frequency of hospital admissions and with a lower quality of life. 32 subjects, or 71%, had severe insight deficits or even lack of insight. These findings were associated with higher optimism, and a lower rate of perceived stress. Patients who benefited of support system and had an adequate social context had fewer hospital admissions.</p><p id="__p2664">Conclusion: We could advance the premise that the incapacity to benefit from this higher insight is due to the poor quality of the supporting system in our country.

Depression adversely affects subjective and objective evaluations of recovery following medical interventions. The present research tests the hypothesis that emotional closeness facilitates an adaptive positive affective reaction, denoted by reduction of depression and anxiety, following liver transplantation.</p><p id="__p2681">Methods: The sample included 74 liver transplant surgery candidates and their primary caregivers. Patients ranged in age (18-74) and were 62.1% male. Data was collected prior to transplant and at 6-month follow-up. Caregivers rated the &#x0201c;degree of closeness you feel in your relationship to the [patient]&#x0201d; on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0-7.

The purpose of this study was to describe Japanese dialysis patients&#x02019; views about advantages and disadvantages of their dialysis treatments (CHD: in-center hemodialysis, CAPD: continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, APD: automated PD).</p><p id="__p2690">Methods: Forty-one participants, including 17 CHD, 17 CAPD, and 7 APD patients (mean age: 58.5&#x000a0;year old (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.6), mean dialysis period: 43.5&#x000a0;months (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;29.2)), were requested to undergo a semi-structured interview, and the data obtained were qualitatively analyzed.</p><p id="__p2691">Results: The participants considered that their dialysis modalities had its advantages and disadvantages. In terms of advantage, &#x0201c;less trouble for the people around me&#x0201d; was the most common answer of all dialysis modalities. "Independence", "less hospital visit", and "flexibility" were advantages of CAPD and APD patients. On the other hand, CHD patients consider the advantages of the treatment were "professional care" and "dialysis-free days". As for disadvantage, "catheter care" and &#x0201c;making trouble for the people around me&#x0201d; were the common answers of CAPD and APD patients.

Although behavioral interventions are one of the most effective treatments to such populations, the relationship often encounters difficulties and the therapy becomes unprogressive. It is partly because of their limitation of ability to use language which enables them to understand and express their thoughts, feelings and understandings. The aim of this descriptive study is to show some of the examples of inventive approaches which thought to be helpful to the progression of the therapies for the patients with a mental handicap.</p><p id="__p2699">Method (process of treatment): The patients were male 20&#x000a0;s and female 30&#x000a0;s, both were unmarried and lived with their families. Three years of outpatient therapy, conducted once every two to three weeks, took place at the psychiatric hospital. Medication and behavioral interventions, including management of use of social welfare services and psycho-education, were given. In addition, the following approaches were developed in the course of treatment: (1) Psychiatrist and psychologist worked as a team to deal with the patients, and discussed about emotional burden that had been experienced. (2) The patients were asked to come to therapy by themselves and with their families alternatively. (3) Importance of attending work at the welfare facility was emphasized at each session and patients&#x02019; refusals of work were disputed thoroughly. The patients gradually have become to hold back complaining and maladaptive behaviors decreased.</p><p id="__p2700">Discussions: In order to maintain the therapy relationships and prevent drop out, three approaches listed above seemed useful. Approach (1) may enable therapists to manage negative feelings toward patient which are often underestimated in the case of patient with mental handicap. Approach (2) may give patients the room for privacy and it may also enable to observe and approach family problems at the same time. Approach (3) may set strong therapeutic framework which enables both patients and therapists to realize small progresses that have been achieved through course of therapy. Quantitative research and experimental study will be needed to specify the effect of these approaches.</p><p id="__p2701">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Takao Suzuki, Master&#x02019;s, Waseda University, Tokorozawa, 359-1145; suz-takao@aoni.waseda.jp</p><p id="__p2702">PST-115</p><p id="__p2703">RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION IN INTERVENTION TRIALS: LISTENING TO HIV-POSITIVE MOTHERS&#x02019; EXPERIENCES IN THE MOMS PROGRAM</p><p id="__p2704">Katharine E.

Indeed, recruitment rates in recent published reports of behavioral interventions focused on health improvement in such populations range from as low as 13.5% to as high as 59%. Methods: We conducted post-intervention focus groups with 15 participants in the Making Our Mothers Stronger (MOMS) Project, a randomized behavioral intervention. MOMS participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental condition of a parenting skills intervention or to an attention-control condition of a health related behaviors intervention. Two focus groups were conducted with participants from each intervention condition. A focus group guide ensured consistency between groups and covered participants&#x02019; response to the MOMS Project as well as their perceptions and recommendations about recruitment and retention. Three coders developed a codebook using constant comparison to identify major themes and sub-themes. Results: 87% of the focus group participants were African-American; their mean age was 41&#x000a0;years and 53% were single/never married. Identified themes included approaches to and venues for recruitment success, the role of key staff, effective and ineffective incentives, the impact of group process on recruitment and retention, and program resources that are needed. Discussion: Specific recommendations that emerged from the focus groups include recruiting in trusted venues, employing a persistent and encouraging recruiter who is sensitive to stigma issues, ensuring acceptability of recruitment materials through field-testing, ensuring social benefits of the intervention are immediate, and providing programs that are highly salient and practical.</p><p id="__p2707">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Katharine E.

Introduction:</p><p id="__p2713">Taken consistently, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), has demonstrated success in inhibiting HIV viral load replication and reducing morbidity and mortality for people living with HIV. However, adherence to HAART is often suboptimal, compromising the effectiveness of treatment. The Seattle Treatment Education Program (STEP) aims to mitigate treatment adherence barriers by providing education and support through empirically driven, strengths-based, behavior change interventions.</p><p id="__p2714">B. Description:</p><p id="__p2715">The STEP program is based upon a harm-reductionist framework, within a larger agency which ascribes to congruent ideology. Interventions are strengths-based and grounded in Rogerian, Motivational Interviewing and Solution Focused clinical orientations. Clients meet with a Treatment Education Coordinator (TEC) to assess their specific treatment-related questions, concerns, and barriers. The TEC and client strategize to create concrete steps to maintain adherence. Evidence-based tools, including symptom and barrier assessors, incentives, and regular follow ups, are utilized. Monitoring and evaluating outcomes is completed regularly through use of a specialized database, and qualitative surveys distributed to clients and referring parties.</p><p id="__p2716">C. Lessons Learned:</p><p id="__p2717">Eighty percent of STEP participants maintained or achieved the 95% HAART adherence rate suggested for optimal treatment outcomes. The literature suggests that the grounding theories in which STEP is based are efficacious in brief treatment settings, and our outcomes data supports this assertion. Limitations of the intervention include participant attrition and insufficient access to comprehensive mental health and substance use management resources.</p><p id="__p2718">D. Further Recommendations:</p><p id="__p2719">For many, maintaining treatment adherence is challenging. Implementing programs that offer unlimited sessions of mental health counseling and substance use treatment or harm-reduction strategies for people living with HIV could greatly increase treatment adherence. Additionally, public health policy could be modified with the aim of de-stigmatizing those living with HIV/AIDS. Effective legislation could include acts recognizing and legitimizing same sex couples. Comprehensive, accessible health care should be provided to anyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. These changes could help mitigate the shame reported by some people living with HIV/AIDS, potentially leading to greater help seeking behaviors and lower transmission rates. Additionally, embracing HIV testing as a routine component of primary care could help to reduce HIV incidence and minimize stigma, potentially leading to a number of positive personal and public health outcomes, including increased treatment adherence.</p><p id="__p2720">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Katie Querna, MSW, Lifelong AIDS Alliance, Seattle, WA, 98122; katieq@llaa.org</p><p id="__p2721">PST-117</p><p id="__p2722">THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HIV RISK PERCEPTIONS (GLOBAL VS.

Yet, empirical findings concerning the perception-behavior link have been inconsistent. Despite the efforts made by quite a few researchers in identifying inherent conceptual and methodological limitations in the literature, only a few studies have explicitly addressed these issues. Among others, one such issue related to the use of global (unconditional) and conditional measure of risk perception. In this study, the significance of the associations between HIV-related risk behaviors and perceived risk of contracting HIV measured by two approaches (global and conditional sexual/injecting risk estimates) was tested and compared among a group of sexually active male injecting drug users in China. Of all 456 respondents, 82.5% had unprotected sex and 11.2% shared syringes with others for drug injection in the past six months. In response to the global risk perception, 12.5% perceived high chance of HIV infection. When the risk perception is conditional on unprotected sex and syringe-sharing respectively, the corresponding figures were 38.8% and 71.9%. Logistic regression analyses revealed that syringe-sharing was positively associated with global risk perception (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.29; 95%CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.07,8.92) but negatively associated with conditional injecting risk perception (AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53; 95%CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.29,0.97). Unprotected sex was not associated with global risk perception but was negatively associated with conditional sexual risk perception (AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.46; 95%CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.27,0.76). There are some common and different predictors for the three measures of risk perceptions. The results highlight and confirm the importance of the choice of measures in assessing HIV risk perception.

A study should be conducted in Ibadan Nigeria for the homeless youths living with HIV. This study will determine the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of homeless youths regarding HIV infection. Self administered semi structured questionnaire would be administered by 70% of the homeless youth with HIV.

Participants were assessed twice within a 3&#x000a0;year time period: initially in 2004, shortly after they had recovered from the acute phase of SARS, and again 3&#x000a0;years later in 2007. Prevalence of PTSD among patients was 30% in 2007 compared to 15.6% in 2004. The association between PTSD symptoms and demographic variables (i.e., age at infection, age at testing, gender, education, marital status, and living arrangement), job type, severity of disease (i.e., ICU requirement, respiratory failure, low oxygen saturation, cardiac failure), duration of hospitalization, and duration of quarantine was identified using Spearman rank-order correlations. A stepwise regression analysis was performed for each of the PTSD symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal. All potential mediating factors (those identified in univariate analyses with a significance of P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were entered into the analysis). Results indicated that age at infection significantly contributed to the variance in PTSD symptoms of hyperarousal and re-experiencing in 2004 (at P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01 levels) and had an inverse relationship with these two variables. Duration of hospitalization significantly increased the R square value in predicting symptoms of hyperarousal in 2004. Interaction of age at infection and duration of hospitalization explained 33.5% of the variance in symptom of hyperarousal in 2004 (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.06; df&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, 28; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.003).

Most of the previous work has been conducted with men, especially gay and bisexual men. Relatively few studies have examined the use of the Internet for romance among women. Even fewer have had a strong theoretical base. In the present study, we recruited women (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;255) from MySpace and other Internet venues to complete measures assessing demographic information, sexual behavior, and components of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model. Overall, 31% of women reported that they had had sex with someone they initially &#x0201c;met&#x0201d; online. Women who used the Internet for romance reported more partners in the previous 3&#x000a0;months (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.74, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.86) than women who had not (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.47, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.55), a significant difference (Mann-Whitney Z&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.54, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Two components of the IMB model were associated with sexual risk behavior. Perceptions of peer norms for sexual activity (a motivational construct) were associated with higher numbers of sexual partners (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.27, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Higher self-efficacy for condom use (a behavioral skills component) was associated with fewer sexual partners (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.16, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). In this study, the IMB component of information was not predictive of risk. Results suggest that risk associated with using the Internet to find partners is not restricted to men. Women in the present study may be at risk for a variety of negative outcomes of sexual activity, including contracting HIV or other sexually-transmitted infections, and unwanted pregnancy.</p><p id="__p2750">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Eric G.

Factors associated with non-disclosure include stigma, fear of rejection, fear of violence, and privacy concerns. In work with populations at risk for HIV, psychopathy (a personality characteristic associated with antisocial behavior and egocentrism) has been associated with substance use and sexual risk behavior. Little work has explored associations between psychopathy, disclosure, and risk in HIV-positive adults. In the present study, HIV-positive men and women (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;310) were recruited from the waiting room of an infectious disease clinic. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing demographic information, disclosure of HIV status, psychopathy, and sexual risk behavior. The majority (74%) of participants disclosed their HIV status to all sex partners in the past 3&#x000a0;months. Individuals who did not disclose their HIV status to all partners scored significantly higher in psychopathy (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.00, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.22) than those who had disclosed (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;21.02, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.91; F&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.98, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Higher psychopathy scores were associated with higher rates of having sex after drinking (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20), having sex after using drugs (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.24), the number of sexual partners (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.13) and unprotected vaginal and anal sex acts in the past 3&#x000a0;months (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.13; all ps&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Higher psychopathy scores were also associated with lower intentions to use condoms with future partners (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.22, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Findings suggest that psychopathy is associated with risk behavior among HIV-positive men and women. Disclosure of HIV status has the potential to help reduce the spread of HIV.

Studies have suggested that personality traits have an influence on sexual behaviors to facilitate the HIV infection. Moreover, the perception of risk is one of the main factors to consider in sexual prevention of HIV. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of personality traits on &#x0201c;perceived risk of HIV infection&#x0201d;, in a sample of 120 Spanish university students with a mean age of 19.79 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.33). Data were collected from the "AIDS Prevention Questionnaire&#x0201d; (Ballester et al., 2004), which evaluates relevant variables to HIV prevention. Specifically, we have used the questions related to the component "perceived risk": perceived severity, probability of infection risk and perceived fear. Secondly, the Personality Inventory NEO-PI-R (Costa &#x00026; McCrae, 1992) was used to measure personality traits. Results showed that perceived probability of infection correlated positively and significantly with Neuroticism (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.257, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.005) and with three of its traits: Depression (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.242, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.008), Impulsivity (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.185, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.044) and Vulnerability (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.243, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.008). Regarding to perceived fear, was observed a significant positive correlation with Impulsivity (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.182, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.048) (Ns trait) and Gregariousness (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.204, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.026) (Es trait). Finally, perception of severity got a significant positive correlation with Modesty (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.222, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.015) (As trait). That is, people with higher scores on traits related to psychological distress, tend to perceive greater likelihood of HIV infection. While people with higher scores on traits related to social interaction, tend to perceive greater fear and severity toward the disease. In conclusion, personality traits are really relevant to understand significant variables of HIV transmission, as well as to understand risky sexual behavior and more vulnerable population.</p><p id="__p2771">Research was supported by Universitat Jaume I-Fundaci&#x000f3; Bancaixa (P1 1B2006-19) and Foundation for Research and prevention of AIDS in Spain (exp. 36639/07)</p><p id="__p2772">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Rafael Ballester Arnal, doctorate in psychology, Psicolog&#x000ed;a B&#x000e1;sica, Cl&#x000ed;nica y Psicobiolog&#x000ed;a, Universitat Jaume I, Castellon, 12071; gomezs@psb.uji.es</p><p id="__p2773">PST-124</p><p id="__p2774">PERSEVERANCE, SUBSTANCE USE, AND SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIOR IN GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN</p><p id="__p2775">Eric G.

Relatively little research in health psychology and behavioral medicine has examined relationships between the constructs of positive psychology and health-relevant behaviors. The present study assessed associations between perseverance, substance use and sexual risk behavior in gay and bisexual men. Participants attending a gay pride celebration (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;350) completed measures of perseverance, demographics, substance use and sexual risk behavior. Perseverance was associated with years of formal education (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.27, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01) and income (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.22) but was unrelated to age, employment status, or HIV status.

SARS was an infectious illness that spread to 29 countries in 2002/2003, infecting over 8,000 people, 774 of whom died. Method: A literature search was conducted on available electronic databases, including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. The search produced only a small number of articles published pertaining to the psychological symptoms and experience of patients (total of 28 original studies and 3 early reviews). No studies were found that assessed the emotional impact beyond 18&#x000a0;months post-infection. Studies used various methods of appraisal: self-report, standardized measures or questionnaires of original design, and a small number of studies employed hospital chart reviews. For the purpose of this study, the research results were divided into two recovery stages: early stages (&#x0003c;3&#x000a0;months post infection), and later stages (&#x0003e;3&#x000a0;months post-infection). Results: Early study variables that emerged included &#x0201c;worry about infecting others,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;elevated emotional distress,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;changes in mood,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;symptoms of acute stress disorder,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;feelings of stigmatization,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;psychiatric complications,&#x0201d; such as the presence of psychotic symptoms (possibly secondary to steroid toxicity). Later stage variables included &#x0201c;emotional distress&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;depressed mood&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;posttraumatic stress symptoms.&#x0201d; Evidence of psychological problems developing in the later stages was also found in a small proportion of survivors. Conclusion: The limited number of published studies available for review consistently reported high rates of emotional distress in patients in both the early stages and later stages of recovery up to 18&#x000a0;months post-infection, with worry about infecting others, feelings of stigmatization, and psychotic symptoms emerging earlier in the recovery process. The levels of psychological distress found in these studies are similar to those reported in other comparable chronic physical illnesses. SARS remains a new disease, and the course of its development, both physically and emotionally, is still unfolding as time progresses. Longer term follow-up to determine the course of SARS patients&#x02019; psychological status will help to guide treatment interventions. This, in turn, will help to inform the needs for future emergent, possibly similar, viral infections.</p><p id="__p2784">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Paula Gardner, EdD, Back on Track Program, St. John&#x02019;s Rehab Hospital, Toronto, ON, M2M 2G1; pgardner@stjohnsrehab.com</p><p id="__p2785">PST-126</p><p id="__p2786">DOES DEPRESSION INFLUENCE ON HIV RISK BEHAVIOR OF YOUTH?</p><p id="__p2787">Rafael Ballester Arnal, doctorate in psychology,<sup>1</sup> Maria Dolores Gil, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Estefan&#x000ed;a Ruiz, Postgraduate<sup>1</sup> and Cristina Gim&#x000e9;nez, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p2788"><sup>1</sup>Psicolog&#x000ed;a B&#x000e1;sica, Cl&#x000ed;nica y Psicobiolog&#x000ed;a, Universitat Jaume I, Castellon, Spain and <sup>2</sup>Psicolog&#x000ed;a evolutiva y de la educaci&#x000f3;n, Universidad de Valencia.

In this context, different programs of prevention have been developed successfully, although there have been some barriers to achieve changing risk behavior. In this experience, dispositional characteristics have been revealed really important. Thus, considering the complexity of risk behaviors, we should improve our knowledge about mediator variables in HIV behaviors. For example, depression has revealed some influences related to HIV risk on different population but this has not been specified yet in youth. Our study analyzed the influence of depression on significance variables associated with HIV transmission, such as knowledge, attitudes, behavior and behavior intention. Participants were 170 students recruited from University of Castellon (Spain), 18-21&#x000a0;years old,. They were administered anonymously two questionnaires: NEO-PIR (Costa &#x00026; McCrae, 1992) related to personality traits and AIDS Prevention Questionnaire (Ballester, Gil, Guirado &#x00026; Bravo, 2004) about HIV/AIDS. Correlation analyses showed with significance statistical that more levels of depression are associated with higher personal risk perception (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.242, p&#x000a3;.008), more condom use in regular partner (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.229, p&#x000a3;.021) and less intention to have a sexual relation without condom (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.193, p&#x000a3;.038). Depression factor is closed to reveal statistical significance related to information about HIV (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.179, p&#x000a3;.051) but analyses have not showed any relation to confidence about condom (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.026, .777), fear perceived (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.107, p&#x000a3;.246) or condom use in sporadic partner (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.071, p&#x000a3;.536). These findings suggest a complex influence of depression in youth risk in different levels such as attitudes or behavior.

Not surprisingly, mental health needs frequently rise to the forefront of concerns clinicians must address prior to, or alongside, medical treatment. A better understanding of how to assess the psychosocial needs of this vulnerable population can help inform interventions to improve self-care and health outcomes. The preliminary data presented in this study includes 114 participants who have completed their initial visits of a study assessing coping styles as predictors of adherence in an urban sample of YPLH in the United States. The sample consisted of patients ranging from 13&#x02013;22&#x000a0;years old. Using an Audio Computer Assisted Survey Instrument (ACASI), study participants responded to questions from a self-report mental health assessment instrument. Results indicated that only 10-15% showed signs of mental health needs that approached clinical levels. However, an examination of mental health screening records provided a clearer picture of the diagnostic profile of the ACASI respondents. When screened by a psychologist, nearly half of the participants were diagnosed with at least one mental health condition. Of these, 44% were diagnosed with a depressive disorder while 8% an anxiety disorder and 24% an attentive disorder. Several had multiple diagnoses. Clinicians treating YPLH should rely on methods beyond self-report tools to screen for mental health needs in order to develop a treatment plan and make referrals as appropriate.</p><p id="__p2806">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Ricardo D.

Over the years decreasing rates of participation have been reported in population based studies. Consequently, differences between participants and non-participants in distribution of the exposure to an outcome may be present. This question, whether results from population based studies can be generalized to the background population.</p><p id="__p2826">Results: Participants born in 1991 (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,666) were compared with adolescents born in 1991 who did not participate in The Danish Youth Cohort (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;56,619) through registries in The Statistics Denmark. We found that non-participants were more likely to be of lower socio-economic groups.</p><p id="__p2827">Further, participants at baseline with follow-up in 2007 (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;3777) were compared with participants at baseline with no follow-up (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;8721). We found that adolescents who at baseline had tried drinking one unit of alcohol (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.87, CI: 0.81-0.94), had experienced being drunk (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85, CI: 0.77-0.94), and who smoked (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65, CI: 0.49-0.88) have lower risk of follow-up two years after baseline.</p><p id="__p2828">Conclusions: Our study confirms what already is known from many other previous study cohorts; that lower socio-economic groups are underrepresented in epidemiological studies. Methods to account for low participation rates in cohort studies have been introduced. Future analysis in the Danish Youth Cohort may overcome the rather low participation rate, and hereby the skewed sample, by for example weighting some characteristics of non-participation.</p><p id="__p2829">Regarding attrition, only 25 % was followed up from baseline in 2005 to second follow-up in 2007.

Data from the Danish Youth Cohort can be used to investigate research question that require longitudinal data. However, in future research on alcohol or smoking the high attrition should be considered.</p><p id="__p2830">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Mathilde Vinther-Larsen, Candscientsanpubl, The child health programme, National Institute of Public Health, Copenhagen, 1353; mvl@niph.dk</p><p id="__p2831">PST-129</p><p id="__p2832">ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN VO2MAX AND VITALITY IN OLDER WORKERS: THE VITAL@WORK STUDY</p><p id="__p2833">Jorien E.

These subjective factors can be positively affected by physical activity. Since vigorous physical activity is strongly related to aerobic fitness (VO2max), it is hypothesised that VO2max is related also to vitality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between vitality and estimated VO2max in older workers.</p><p id="__p2836">Methods: Participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;427) were aged 45&#x000a0;years and over, and worked for at least 16 hours a week at a large hospital in the Netherlands. VO2max was estimated at baseline using the 2-km UKK walk test. Vitality was measured by both the UWES Vitality Scale and the RAND-36 Vitality Scale.

However, there was no association found between VO2max and vitality measured by the UWES Vitality Scale. These results suggest that the two measurements of vitality (i.e. UWES and RAND-36) measure different constructs of vitality: e.e. a mental component (UWES Vitality Scale) and a physical component (RAND-36 Vitality Scale).

Poor health literacy in English has been observed among foreign-born Chinese, yet evaluation of health literacy has not been attempted in their primary language. To ensure the cultural appropriateness of health literacy tools for this population, we involved linguists, health educators, and clinicians in the design of new tools in Chinese, employing the same methods used to develop the Rapid Estimates of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA), rather than direct translation of these established tools in English. We developed the Rapid Estimate of Adult Health Literacy in Chinese (REAHLC) scale, a 10-item word recognition test. We used the modified cloze procedure to design the Chinese Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (CSTOFHLA), consisting of two paragraphs drawn from existing Chinese health education materials with 35 multiple choice questions. Higher scores on both tools indicated higher health literacy. We pilot tested these tools with 32 adult Chinese immigrants (68.8% female; mean age: 49.6&#x000a0;years) recruited from a Chinese community health center in New York City. Participants completed the REAHLC, CSTOFHLA, a Chinese literacy test with 10 items in Chinese (CLT), and a demographic questionnaire. REAHLC and CLT scores were significantly correlated (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.40, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), though none of the tools&#x02019; scores were associated with CSTOFHLA scores (ps&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.05). Our findings provide beginning evidence that word literacy and functional health literacy may be different in Chinese. REAHLC scores correlated with years of education in China (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.38, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), while CSTOFHLA scores were negatively associated with age (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.50, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), respectively suggesting that individuals with higher education in China have higher word literacy and younger adults tend to have higher functional health literacy. Our study designed the first health literacy screening tools in Chinese that are culturally appropriate.

Various designs provide different information and quality of information, and this should be put in a perspective in the analyses and in the interpretation of the results from available data. Depending on how an outcome (e.g. return to work) is measured various statistical methods are natural. This presentation discusses the use of extended event history analyses in multi-state models for the analyses of sick leave data. Using multi-state models, one can exploit more of the data available in the evaluation of interventions to reduce sickness absence or the effect after rehabilitation programs. We show the advantage of multi state models uses two datasets as examples. The first data is from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on 256 individuals with low back pain, while the second data is an uncontrolled study on 577 individuals with different diagnosis after an 8&#x000a0;week stay at a rehabilitation clinic. For the RCT we show that the intervention increases the number of days in work with 46&#x000a0;day during a period of three years, while for the uncontrolled study we find that 60 % of the participants return to work.</p><p id="__p2851">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Stein Atle Lie, PhD, Uni Health, Uni Research, Bergen, 5015; stein.lie@uni.no</p><p id="__p2852">PST-132</p><p id="__p2853">THE SPANISH VERSION OF THE SUBJECTIVE HEALTH COMPLAIN INVENTORY</p><p id="__p2854">Eduardo Remor, PhD</p><p id="__p2855">Psychobiology and Health Psychology, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.</p><p id="__p2856">The Subjective Health Complaint Inventory (SHC; Eriksen, Ihlebaek and Ursin, 1999), consists of 29 items concerning subjective somatic and psychological complaints experienced during the last 30&#x000a0;days. Severity of each complaint included in the inventory is rated on a 4-point scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;none, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;some, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;much, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe). Each complaint is also scored for duration (number of days) during the last 30&#x000a0;days. The product of severity and duration can be used to obtain a total score (0 - 90) indicating the degree of health problems (absence of positive health). The SHC inventory include 5 Subscales (flu, pain, allergy, anxiety and gastrointestinal) and a total health complain score is possible to get as well. The SHC is available in several languages, and psychometric properties were previously described for different language versions. The present work describe the adaptation process for the Spanish language and preliminary psychometrics.</p><p id="__p2857">Method: The English version of the SHC inventory was translated to Spanish by two experts, the Spanish version were reviewed by a third colleague to check the accuracy of the translation. This version was backtranslated to English by an independent translator. Backtranslated version was contrasted with the English original by the two initial experts. The Spanish version was then piloted with a small group of health adults to check comprehension of the items and wording. No suggestions were made by pilot subjects. Then final version of the SHC inventory in Spanish was considered achieved. These steps were followed by a psychometric study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;83). Evidences of reliability (internal consistency), validity (construct validity, CFA) and sensitivity to change (after an intervention) were assessed.</p><p id="__p2858">Results and conclusions: Results will be described in detail in the poster.

The procedure is almost same as empty chair technique, but written language is used instead of spoken. Haruguchi (1987) indicated several original effects of RLT. That is, 1) clarification of emotions, 2) self counseling, 3) catharsis, 4) confrontation and acceptance, 5) acquisition of both sides&#x02019; viewpoints, etc.</p><p id="__p2865">In empirical RLT studies, increase of self-esteem, "adult&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nurturing parent&#x0201d; (in egogram)" was pointed out (Hosoi et al., 2002; Okamoto, 2006). And in case studies, expressed emotions, insight, self-awareness were suggested as significant indicators of this therapy. But it is necessary so that qualitative studies with objective summary tool clarify long sentences. In this study, description codes for RLT are structured, and the applications are discussed.</p><p id="__p2866">METHOD: Sentences extracted from 12 articles and 2 technical books about RLT were categorized by using KJ method. The codes were examined two steps of validity (correspondence, usability, frequency, clinical importance) by 3-5 researchers. And the reliability was confirmed by concordance rate of the coding by 7 researchers and graduate students.</p><p id="__p2867">RESULT: As a result of classification, 15 codes for &#x0201c;letters to another&#x0201d; and 14 codes for &#x0201c;letter to self&#x0201d; were structured. The former consists of &#x0201d;anger/dissatisfaction&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;dependence&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;need/hope&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;reflection/awareness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;care/thoughtfulness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;gratefulness&#x0201d;, etc. The latter consists of &#x0201c;complaint/blame&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;enmeshment&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;advice/opinion&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;expectation/wish&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;care&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;comprehension/regard&#x0201d;, etc. A rate of agreement in 2 people&#x02019;s cording (in arbitrary 3 in 7) is 82.2%, therefore, these cords need the use in more than 3 people.</p><p id="__p2868">DISCUSSION: The codes are in practical use stage, and have following utilizations. a) Discovering patterns in letters, b) convert a description into variables, c) comparison of technique. Furthermore, it can be applied to RLT as a supporting tool for understanding. For example, ascertaining a fluctuation in the number of the cords leads to understanding of client&#x02019;s power of expression.</p><p id="__p2869">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Shuhei Kaneko, PhD, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Tottori University, Yonago city, 683-8503; skaneko@med.tottori-u.ac.jp\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583830718240" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figu_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figu_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figu_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583830718240" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p2870">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sri Idaiani, Dr, Ministry of Health Republic of Indonesia, National Institute of Health Research and Development, Bekasi, 17134; sriidaiaini@yahoo.com</p><p id="__p2871">PST-135a</p><p id="__p2872">NEW METHOD OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE RESEARCH FROM THE CLIENT&#x02019;S PERSPECTIVE</p><p id="__p2873">Hideko Itoh, MA</p><p id="__p2874">National Institute of Multimedia Education, Tokyo, Japan.</p><p id="__p2875">The experiences of the author, a psychologist, regarding clinical depression were analyzed in order to develop new research methods for behavioral medicine. The analysis focused on self-investigation, quantitative and qualitative approaches, and an evidence-based approach for the individual. In Period I (1994-2000), a female client was treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) by a clinical psychology professor. In Period II (2000-2005), pharmacotherapy was conducted by a psychosomatician. In Period III (2005-present), CBT and holistic medical treatment were conducted by another psychosomatician. In the second year of Period III (Period III-2), to facilitate self-regulation, Self-Efficacy and Self-Evaluation Scales were developed with the following items: 1. Absorb fulfilling experiences, 2. Keep good memories, 3. Achieve the research goals, 4. Calmly express feelings, 5. Change one&#x02019;s mood to cope with or avoid stress, 6. Regulate drowsiness, 7. Assert own opinion, 8. Ward off unimportant things, 9. Keep appropriate distance from others, and 10. Keep good personal relationships. Items 1-6 were common to Periods III-2-III-5, whereas items 7-9 were used in Periods III-2 and III-3 and integrated into item 10 in Periods III-4 and III-5. In each session, the client rated her pre-practice self-efficacy and post-practice self-evaluation. Average self-efficacy and self-evaluation scores descended in the order of items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 4. Self-efficacy and self-evaluation scores on items 7-9 increased from Period III-2 to Period III-3. Most of the problems occurred in the family and relatives area. The top three reasons for positive discrepancy of the scores (evaluation - efficacy) include fewer problems occurred, or there was less sensitivity to the problems, executed things in workplace or personal areas, and maintained good communications. Correlations among self-efficacy scores on items 1-3 and 5 were significant in Periods III-4 and III-5. These results suggest that the client became able to cope with the problems and stress. The significance of this research is discussed in relation to &#x0201c;clients as researchers.&#x0201d;</p><p id="__p2876">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hideko Itoh, MA, National Institute of Multimedia Education, Tokyo, 169-0051; hideko.lisa.itoh@gmail.com</p><p id="__p2877">PST-135b</p><p id="__p2878">VALIDATION OF A KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOUR QUESTIONNAIRE FOR DIETARY EDUCATION IN MALAYSIAN DIABETIC PATIENTS</p><p id="__p2879">Amutha Ramadas, MSc,<sup>1</sup> Carina K.

Diabetes-related knowledge deficits and inadequate self-care practices has been identified among the majority of Malaysian diabetic patients with suboptimal glycaemic control. Rationale &#x00026; Objective: The evidence available on management of diabetes mellitus via dietary education, improving the knowledge, attitude and behaviour (KAB) of the patient is rather limited. Existing validated questionnaires measure general diabetes knowledge, which are not specifically meant to measure KAB related to diet and there is no published data on a validated dietary KAB questionnaire unique to Malaysian diabetic patients. There is a need for a KAB questionnaire that is explicitly developed for Malaysians as dietary habits are unique and very closely related to the culture of the population. Thus, this study aims to develop and validate a dietary KAB questionnaire for diabetic patients in Malaysia. Methods: The content of the KAB questionnaire was developed, and its face and content validity was determined by a panel of experts. In total, 36 questions were administered in 30 type 2 diabetic patients attending out-patient clinics in 3 public hospitals. Internal consistency was determined using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha (CA) coefficient. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine the reliability. The KAB scores were used to determine the sensitivity of the questionnaire. Results &#x00026; Discussion: The Flesch Reading Ease score was 74.6% suggesting the questions were reasonably easy to understand.The CA was 0.72, while the ICCs were between 0.71 and 0.92. There was no significant difference in test-retest mean KAB score, indicating the questionnaire is sensitive enough to detect the changes in patients&#x02019; response. Conclusion: A reliable KAB measure of dietary education for Malaysian diabetic patients has been developed and validated.</p><p id="__p2882">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Carina K.

To overcome this concern, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and the day reconstruction method (DRM) have recently been used, but the validity of these methods has not been objectively examined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the validity of EMA and DRM by using physical activity level (PAL) as an objective external criterion. Twenty-two healthy undergraduates (age 21.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.6&#x000a0;yrs) wore a watch-type computer and recorded visual analog scales of fatigue and depressive mood at different EMA design; recorded momentary symptoms every two hours (time-based) and recorded the symptoms during the behavioral episode which was just finished when switching one behavior to another (episode-based). They also recorded the symptoms afterward according to the series of behavioral episodes they reconstructed (DRM) about the same days. PAL was obtained using an actigraph built into the watch-type computer. Multilevel modeling showed that the association between depressive mood recorded with time-based EMA and PAL averaged over 60 minutes around EMA recording was significantly negative (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002); however, depressive mood recorded with episode-based EMA and DRM had no association with PAL averaged over the period of corresponding episodes. As for fatigue, none of the methods showed significant association with averaged Pal. These results suggest that time-based EMA might have the validity against the objective PAL when assessing depressive mood in contrast to episode-based EMA and DRM. Though averaged PAL alone failed to confirm the validity of all three methods used in this study as assessment of fatigue, incorporating other PAL measures than a simple average might distinguish the validity of them and need to be investigated.</p><p id="__p2888">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jinhyuk Kim, MSc, Graduate School of Education, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-0033; grefur@gmail.com</p><p id="__p2889">PST-135d</p><p id="__p2890">FURTHER VALIDATION OF THE TYPE D PERSONALITY SCALE (DS-14) IN HONG KONG CHINESE COMMUNITY- CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS</p><p id="__p2891">Yi-jie Wang, PhD candidate, Siu-man Ng, PhD and Ted, C.T.

Dahlquist, PhD</p><p id="__p2916">Psychology, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD.</p><p id="__p2917">Emerging evidence suggests that immersive Virtual Reality (VR) distraction is an efficacious intervention for procedural pain. VR distraction offers an alternative to pharmacological treatments that may cause adverse side effects. Although VR distraction has been demonstrated to be effective in laboratory and clinical settings, the method by which it works to combat pain remains unclear. McCaul and Malott (1984) hypothesize that pain processing requires conscious attention. A highly immersive distractor should leave less attention available for pain processing. This study examined whether a VR head-mounted display helmet increases the analgesic effects of interactive distraction. A head-mounted display occludes extraneous sights and sounds, helping a person feel &#x02018;present&#x02019; in the virtual world, leaving less attention available for pain sensations originating outside of the virtual world. Seventy-three college students between the ages of 18 and 25 were exposed to cold pressor pain without any distraction intervention (baseline) and then two cold pressor trials during which they played a Nintendo&#x000ae; Wii videogame. They viewed the game on a 21&#x0201d; TV or through a VR head-mounted display unit. The study used a within-subjects repeated-measures design, with the two videogame distraction trials presented in counterbalanced order following baseline. LOG-10 transformation was conduced on all pain tolerance scores to correct for skew and kurtosis. Results showed that pain tolerance during the baseline trial (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.46, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;.254) was significantly lower than pain tolerance during the helmet-on condition (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.72, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;.329), t(72) = -11.24, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001, and the helmet-off condition (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.68, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;.32), t(72) = -10.69, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001. Participants showed the greatest increases in pain tolerance in the helmet-on condition, t(72) = 2.82, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01.

Analgesics are the most common therapy used to manage pain, with opioids playing an increasingly important role in pharmacological treatment of chronic disabling pain in older adults. The efficacy of medication therapy needs to be balanced against potential side effects, including the risk of neurocognitive impairment. In this study we objectively examined neurocognitive effects of methadone in older adults (&#x0003e;65&#x000a0;years) suffering from daily chronic pain (osteo-arthritis). Older participants (mean age 76&#x000a0;years) were evaluated twice at baseline (prior to the start of medication) and again 24hours after initial dose and again after 5 and 21&#x000a0;days of medication. Subjective ratings of pain along with objective testing of memory, attention and concentration were measured. Physiologic measurement of medication effects (pupil size) were also obtained. Results indicate a slight decline in weekly pain ratings (NS) and a modest drop in pupil size (NS). Neurocognitive tests indicated no significant change from baseline on measures of memory (HVLT), concentration (D2), reaction time or global cognitive measures (MMSE). There was an improvement on a measure of working memory (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and a trend toward improvement on an attention task (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.06). Global measures of functioning did not change. Taken together, results suggest that older adults suffering from chronic non-malignant pain do not experience significant decrements in cognitive functioning in response to methadone. This may be consistent with findings of improved cognition with improved pain control observed in younger samples.</p><p id="__p2924">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Ashley J.

Its complexity difficults the diagnosis and, especially, the sick role experience of patients. In this context, showing a maladaptive illness behavior will produce a negative interference in daily lives of these people, increasing their subjective distress. To improve our knowledge about this topic, our pilot study compares the responses between a group of fibromyalgia patients (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) and a control group (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;13), all of them women, with a mean age of 44. All participants belonged to a local association (Association of Fibromyalgia of Onda). The evaluation instrument was a Spanish adaptation of Illness Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ - Pillowsky and Spencer, 1983) by Ballester (1992), which evaluates attitudes and feelings about the disease, the perception of the reactions of others, and their own perception about the psychosocial situation. Data show higher scores on IBQ factors of all patients with fibromyalgia compared with controls. We got statistically significant in: hypochondriasis (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.247, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.032), disease conviction (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.121, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.042), psychologic vs. somatic focus (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.042, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.005), affective disturbance (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.814, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.008), denial of psychosocial problems (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.865, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001) and Whiteley Index of Hypochondriasis (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.271, p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.003. These results indicate that people who are suffering fibromyalgia have higher predisposition to somatization and seek medical treatment.

We proposed conceptualizing disability, or activity limitations, as behavior and integrating biomedical and behavioral determinants. We previously tested a model including constructs from ICF and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) using structural equation modelling; it fitted better and explained more variance than ICF or SCT alone. The current study replicated that study with a new sample from the same population (orthopedic patients awaiting joint replacement), and extended the tests to after surgery. Two weeks before surgery, 342 orthopedic patients with chronic pain (most having arthritis) completed a questionnaire assessing impairment and activity limitations plus SCT variables (Self-Efficacy and Outcome Expectancy). One year after surgery, when both impairment and activity limitations were reduced, 228 completed the questionnaire again. We imposed the statistical models found in our previous study (before and after surgery) using structural equation modelling, with NNFI, CFI, RMSEA fit indices) to predict activity limitations. Before surgery, findings were very similar to our previous findings, with all models accounting for significant variance and fitting well, but the integrated model fitted better and accounted for more variance. (ICF: 35%; SCT: 60%; Integrated model: 64%). Each model showed stronger predictions after surgery, with the combined model accounting for most variance (ICF: 52%; SCT: 79%; Integrated model: 82%). On each occasion, all three predictor variables had significant coefficients. The integrated model provides a good explanation of disability in this population, superior to a biomedical or behavioral model alone, and identifies targets for intervention to reduce disability.</p><p id="__p2954">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Marie Johnston, PhD, Health Psychology, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, AB; m.johnston@abdn.ac.uk</p><p id="__p2955">PST-145</p><p id="__p2956">POTENTIAL MEDIATORS OF CHANGE IN CHILDREN&#x02019;S PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</p><p id="__p2957">Helen L.

The subjects found in this study consisted of 49 female college students. We put the subjects in three groups, according to ones degree of SE: high SE group, middle SE group and low SE group. We conducted an intervention study using group cognitive-behavioral intervention including the self-monitoring method. We performed a psychological assessment in order to exam SE, self esteem and stress responses, while also applying experimental protocol in the pre, intervention and post period stages. ANOVA of exercise volume disclosed significant group &#x000d7; period interaction. The significant period effect was disclosed in exercise volume and total energy expenditure. In the post period, low SE group showed a significantly lower exercise volume than high SE group. Low SE group had a significantly lower exercise volume, total energy expenditure and step counts in the post period compared in the intervention period. It should be noted that this pilot study was conducted without a follow up period. In the future, we need to examine whether self-monitoring intervention effects physical activities in a follow up period. In conclusion, after we applied group cognitive-behavioral intervention including the self-monitoring method, we discovered that high SE promoted the habituation of exercise while also inhibiting the risk of rebound. Apathy was decreased in only the subjects categorized with low SE using group cognitive-behavioral intervention including the self-monitoring method.</p><p id="__p2969">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jun Tayama, PhD, Center for Health and Community Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, 852-8521; jtayama@nagasaki-u.ac.jp</p><p id="__p2970">PST-148</p><p id="__p2971">DETERMINANTS OF EXERCISE STAGE OF CHANGE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY</p><p id="__p2972">Deborah Da Costa, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Michel Zummer, MD<sup>2</sup> and Mary-Ann Fitzcharles, MD<sup>3</sup>\n</p><p id="__p2973"><sup>1</sup>Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; <sup>2</sup>Rheumatology, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada and <sup>3</sup>Rheumatology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.</p><p id="__p2974">Spondyloarthropathies (SpA) consist of a group of chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by symptoms of back pain, stiffness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. While regular exercise has been shown to be beneficial and is recommended as part of patient self-care, little is known regarding intention to initiate, alter, or maintain exercise in this patient population. This study examined the distribution of exercise stages of change and the biopsychosocial factors which differentiate readiness to exercise among individuals with SpA. Demographic and clinical data (comorbid disease, disease duration), along with self-report standardized questionnaires assessing functional disability, disease activity, depressed mood, perceived stress, leisure time physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, exercise pros and cons and exercise stage of change were collected cross-sectionally from a sample of 125 individuals with SpA. Data were analyzed by frequency analysis, ANOVA and chi-square. Fifty-two percent (52%) of the participants were in the action/maintenance stages for exercise adoption and 49% in the preaction stages (precontemplation&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.8%; contemplation&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.6%, preparation 13.6%). Patients in the preaction stages had more disease activity (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.005), more functional disability (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), higher perceived stress (pp&#x02009;=&#x02009;.008) and reported lower self-efficacy (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.003) and less barriers for exercise (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.008). Gender, age, socioeconomic status (i.e. education, income) and exercise pros did not differ across the stages. These findings suggest that strategies designed to improve exercise self-efficacy, reduce exercise barriers and emphasize the functional and emotional (i.e. stress reducing) health benefits associated with physical activity may be useful for patients with SpA who are less motivationally ready to engage in regular exercise.</p><p id="__p2975">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Deborah Da Costa, PhD, Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 1A1; deborah.dacosta@mcgill.ca</p><p id="__p2976">PST-149</p><p id="__p2977">HABITUAL BEHAVIOR PATTERNS AMONG REGULAR EXERCISERS: A SURVEY STUDY USING THE SELF-REPORT HABIT INVENTORY</p><p id="__p2978">Karyn Tappe, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Alison C.

If it were possible to decrease the cognitive load associated with deciding to exercise, it might be easier to adhere to a regular exercise routine, as it becomes an automatic activity that does not require decision making; this type of behavior would be termed by theorists to be a &#x0201c;habit.&#x0201d; However, empirical evidence is lacking as to whether those individuals who have successfully instituted a regular exercise routine have such aspects of &#x0201c;habit&#x0201d; in their behavior patterns. The present study reports the level of habit formation among regular exercisers using a survey format.</p><p id="__p2981">The Self-Report Habit Inventory (SRHI) (Verplanken &#x00026; Orbell, 2003) measures the subjective sense of habit formation. The present exploratory study surveyed a sample of individuals (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;176) who attended a fitness club in a metropolitan area using the SRHI (with a 7-point Likert scale), as well as objective questions about regularity of behavior (frequency and constancy of time, place, and weekly and seasonal patterns).</p><p id="__p2982">Results indicated a median SRHI-average score of 5.17 (range: 1.25-7.00). Even though this sample was presumed to represent regular exercisers, it was notable that there was a substantial subsample whose scores on the SRHI were quite low. Therefore, a median split was calculated, and participants with low versus high scores were compared on the other (non-SRHI) survey items. Low-SRHI participants exercised significantly fewer days per week (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and their exercise patterns were more likely to change seasonally than high-SRHI scorers (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). However, the groups did not differ in regularly of time (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.52), location (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.14), specific exercise behavior (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.41), or weekly consistency of exercise (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.36). Correlational and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test analyses suggested that individuals who demonstrated constancy on one objective measure of habit were likely to score high on other objective measures of habit as well (ps&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Findings suggest that subjective self-concept of &#x0201c;habit&#x0201d; may not strongly correspond to all objective measures of consistency of behavior, and that only some individuals performing regular exercise behavior do so through a habit formation processes.</p><p id="__p2983">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Karyn Tappe, PhD, none, Sewell, NJ, 08080; karyn.tappe@gmail.com</p><p id="__p2984">PST-150</p><p id="__p2985">FUZZY TRACE THEORY EXPLAINS THE EFFECTS OF EXPERTISE ON DECISION MAKING OF BIKERS</p><p id="__p2986">Efrat Neter, PhD, Moti Gabay, BA and Erez Chayun, B A</p><p id="__p2987">Ruppin Academic Center, Emeq Hefer, Israel.</p><p id="__p2988">Background: Fuzzy Trace Theory (FTT) is a cognitive-developmental theory on representation and memory recently applied to decision making in health domains (Renya, 2007). It posits two processes/representations: &#x02018;Gist&#x02019;, which is bottom-line meaning of information, vague and qualitative, as opposed to &#x02018;Verbatim&#x02019; representation which is the exact surface form (literal), precise and quantitative. The paper applied this theory to examine differences in decision processes of novices and experts in biking. It was hypothesized that experts, who rely on gist processing and less on knowledge, will use fewer information dimensions, reach unequivocal decisions with starker separations among categories, yet make high-quality decisions (as compared to a gold standard).</p><p id="__p2989">Methods: 90 participants, who were novices (up to a year), experienced (one-two years of experience) and expert bikers (two to five years) filled out a self-administered questionnaire comprised of knowledge, intuition, and nine scenarios depicting challenging biking situations. Two recognized experts&#x02019; responses served as a gold standard.</p><p id="__p2990">Findings: Significant differences were found between the groups, so that experts were higher in the knowledge and intuition from the experienced and novices. Experts also relied in their decisions on fewer dimensions of information, provided starker and unequivocal judgments, and made more similar decisions to the golden standards than experienced and novice bikers. Finally, their judgments were based more on intuition (=gist) than on knowledge.</p><p id="__p2991">Conclusion: Experts in sports think differently than novices, and are higher in their use of both knowledge and intuition.</p><p id="__p2992">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Efrat Neter, PhD, Ruppin Academic Center, Emeq Hefer, 40250; neter@ruppin.ac.il</p><p id="__p2993">PST-151a</p><p id="__p2994">SOCIAL FACILITATION WHILE CYBERCYCLING WITH AVATARS AFFECTS EXERCISE BEHAVIOR: DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF COMPETITIVENESS</p><p id="__p2995">Amanda Snyder, BS anticipated,<sup>1</sup> Arielle Gartenberg, BS anticipated,<sup>1</sup> Vadim Yerokhin, BS anticipated,<sup>1</sup> Ciro Griffiths, BS anticipated,<sup>1</sup> Tracey Rocha, BS,<sup>1,2</sup> Joseph Nimon, BS,<sup>1</sup> Paul Arciero, PhD<sup>3</sup> and Cay Anderson-Hanley, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p2996"><sup>1</sup>Psychology, Union College, Schenectady, NY; <sup>2</sup>Counseling Psychology, University at Albany, Albany, NY and <sup>3</sup>Exercise Science, Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY.</p><p id="__p2997">This study evaluated the effects of social facilitation and competiveness on exercise behavior among older adults participating in the Cybercycle Study. Social facilitation is defined as an increase in response due to the presence of others (Allport, 1924). Several theories, such as the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET), have been developed to explain exercise behavior and the influences of intrinsic motivation on performance (Fredrick &#x00026; Ryan, 1995). Some studies have suggested that competitive environments fostered by social facilitation enhance performance on motor tasks (Zajonc, 1965). It was hypothesized that a personality factor, such as competitiveness could influence the effect of social presence. Thirteen older adults (age&#x02009;=&#x02009;78.6) participating in the Cybercycle Study (a randomized clinical trial investigating the neuropsychological, physiological, and behavioral effects of a videogame-enhanced stationary bike) were assigned to ride an exergaming bike while competing against virtual riders. Participant performances during one month (frequency and intensity of rides) were compared with the previous month&#x02019;s performances when no other avatars had been present. Results show that with the introduction of on-screen riders, as competitiveness increased, ride frequency decreased (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.67; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01), while riding intensity increased (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.55; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05). Social facilitation appears to interact with an exerciser&#x02019;s level of competitiveness such that it could enhance or detract from exercise goals, depending on the desired outcomes. This finding has interesting implications for prescribing various types of exercise according to personality style and desired exercise goals.</p><p id="__p2998">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Cay Anderson-Hanley, PhD, Psychology, Union College, Schenectady, NY, 12866; andersoc@union.edu</p><p id="__p2999">PST-151b</p><p id="__p3000">PSYCHOSOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF THE INTENTION OF DAYCARE WORKERS TO MAKE CHILDREN AGED 3 TO 5 YEARS MOVE</p><p id="__p3001">Camille Gagn&#x000e9;, PhD</p><p id="__p3002">Faculty of nursing, Laval university, Quebec, QC, Canada.</p><p id="__p3003">Introduction: Data available in the literature show that children in daycare centres spend most of their time in sedentary activities that could have an incidence on their health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use a combination of theoretical frameworks (theory of planned behaviour, theory of interpersonal behaviour, process model on ease of retrieval) to identify psychosocial factors underlying the intention of daycare workers to make children aged 3 to 5&#x000a0;years move. It is important to study intention, because findings of meta-analyses indicate that this variable is the best determinant of behaviour.</p><p id="__p3004">Method: This study is based on a descriptive correlational design. Daycare centres in the City of Quebec (Canada) were chosen at random. Daycare workers were then invited to complete a questionnaire measuring their intention to make children move for at least two hours a day in the next 30&#x000a0;days, as well as the following variables: attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, self-efficacy, descriptive norm, past behaviour, habit, perceived moral obligation and perceived regularity at which they make the children move. The Cronbach alpha of each construct was satisfactory, with values ranging from .82 to .97. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.</p><p id="__p3005">Findings: Preliminary findings obtained among 37 daycare workers from 15 daycare centres indicate that perceived behavioural control (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;.35), subjective norm (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;.26), perceived moral obligation (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;.23), attitude (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;.20) and the regularity with which daycare workers perceive they make children (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;.14) move explain 87% of the variance in intention F (5,31) = 51.23, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.00.</p><p id="__p3006">Conclusion. These preliminary findings indicate that a large part of the intention of daycare workers to make children move can be explained by factors in the theoretical frameworks selected.

In addition to the psychological object, we must also know its underlying factors; chiefly action, context, and time. When trying to assess an attitude toward a health behavior, it is important to specify as many of the details surrounding the health behavior as possible, otherwise the attitude may be too generalized, or global, to be predictive of actual engagement in the health behavior under question.</p><p id="__p3013">In this two-year multi-site, randomized trial, 75 participants (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;78.99; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.49) were enrolled and assessed using the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 2007) to help determine how personality, disposition toward health behaviors, and environment affect a person&#x02019;s choice to engage in cybercycling.

Exercise has also been shown to increase nutrient supply to capillaries, to decrease neuronal death and to promote an overall better cognitive health (Kramer et al., 2007).

Of particular concern, is Alzheimer&#x02019;s which is on the rise bringing devastating social and economic impacts (Brookmeyer, 2007).

Improvements in psychological well-being have been found with short (15-minute) exercise bouts, and it is possible that a regimen involving short bouts of exercise in a day is superior to one involving a single, long bout of exercise in a day because: (1) the anxiety-reducing effects of any single exercise bout reportedly last 4 to 6 hours, and (2) adherence may be greater because participants find it easier to fit short bouts into their daily schedules.</p><p id="__p3038">This study investigated changes in levels of exercise participation, mood, anxiety and perceived stress in 82 sedentary adults who were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a prescription of twelve 15-minute sessions of walking exercise per week (15Minx12), a prescription of four 45-minute sessions of walking exercise per week (45Minx4), or a waitlist control condition.

Here, we proceeded in the research by investigating if poor sleep quality predicts more comprehensively depressive symptoms as defined by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We used questionnaire data from surveys in 1975, 1981 and 1990 in the Finnish Twin Cohort. In 1990 12,063 persons had data on BDI in 1990 (response rate 77%).

Our sample included 9,529 twins with no missing values on main variables. Based on self-reported sleep quality (five responses dichotomized as Good or Poor) in 1975 and 1981, we categorized the subjects into 4 groups: Good-Good; Poor-Good; Good-Poor; Poor-Poor. Out of BDI items we focused on the dimension Negative Attitudes Toward Self (NATS), including the items on self-dislike, sense of failure, guilt feelings, mood, self-accusation, pessimism, sense of punishment, lack of satisfaction, suicidal wishes, and crying (score 0-25).

These results were replicated when controlling for familial factors among 38 twin pairs discordant for sleep and depression. We conclude that poor sleep independently predicts depressive symptoms. Whether this association is causal calls for further attention.</p><p id="__p3055">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Tellervo Korhonen, PhD, Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, 00014; tellervo.korhonen@helsinki.fi</p><p id="__p3056">PST-153</p><p id="__p3057">SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASES; ASTHMA, BRONCHIECTASIS, COPD AND ASBESTOSIS</p><p id="__p3058">Daljinder Virk, PhD,<sup>1</sup> R.

Although this area has been the topic of some research, certain respiratory disorders, such as sleep apnoea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have received more attention than others.

This subjective/objective disparity poses potential challenges for diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and adds complexity to our conceptualization of the disorder. Insomnia is most common, severe, and impairing in adults over 60&#x000a0;years of age (Lichstein, 2004) and additional impairments may be present in older adults with insomnia that is comorbid with other psychiatric or medical conditions. This population is also at particular risk for making inaccurate subjective impressions of their insomnia symptoms due to a higher endorsement of unrealistic sleep expectations or worry over the effect of compromised sleep on daytime functioning (Morin, 1993). Despite these points, the subjective/objective disparity has not yet been assessed or addressed in this population.</p><p id="__p3071">Method: This study examined the subjective/objective disparity in older adults with comorbid insomnia through a secondary analysis of previously collected data from an R01 grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to a Stress Management and Wellness (SMW) therapy placebo condition in 92 older adults with comorbid insomnia (Rybarczyk, 2005).

After sleep restriction workers try to recover by sleeping at least 8&#x000a0;h a night. We examined the consequences of this kind of sleep-wake pattern on the ability to self-monitor one&#x02019;s own cognitive performance.</p><p id="__p3080">Methods: A total of 20 healthy men (19-29&#x000a0;yr) participated in a laboratory study. 13 of them attended a sleep restriction (SR) condition including a baseline (BL) day (8&#x000a0;h in bed per night), five SR days (4&#x000a0;h in bed), and two recovery (RC) days (8&#x000a0;h in bed). Seven controls slept 7-8&#x000a0;h each night. Each participant had two 50&#x000a0;min multitask sessions daily. After an extensive training phase task difficulty was set individually. Before and after each task session the participants estimated their performance (% of all available scores).</p><p id="__p3081">Results: Both performance and subjective performance estimates were affected by the group-by-day interaction effect (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). In the SR group, these outcomes were at a lower level during the last three SR days than during the BL day (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). In addition, the SR affected selectively the pre-task performance estimates and actual performance: the pre-task estimates decreased less than actual performance during the last two SR days (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). The recovery days restored both the subjective performance estimates and actual performance to their baseline levels. In the control group, neither performance nor the subjective performance estimates showed a decrease over the experimental days.</p><p id="__p3082">Conclusions: Cumulative sleep restriction makes one to prospectively underestimate the actual degree of cognitive impairment. This metacognitive effect of sleep restriction may play a role in an increased accident risk in shift work. Recovery sleep after sleep restriction seems to restore the relationship between subjective performance estimates and actual performance to its baseline level.</p><p id="__p3083">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Mikael Sallinen, PhD, Brain and Work Research Centre, Finnish Institution of Occupational Health, Helsinki, 00250; mikael.sallinen@ttl.fi</p><p id="__p3084">PST-155</p><p id="__p3085">THE IMPACT OF RELIGIOSITY ON HEALTH BELIEFS ABOUT BREAST CANCER AWARENESS IN SOUTH ASIAN MUSLIM WOMEN</p><p id="__p3086">Anna Baker, PhD, Samarah Hashmi, MSc, Jo Skinner, BSc and Eileen O&#x02019;Keefe, PhD</p><p id="__p3087">London Metropolitan, London, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p3088">Breast cancer screening uptake is lower in ethnic minority women compared to white women. In particular South Asian women are less respondent to invitations for screening but also have higher breast cancer risk. This study looked at beliefs about breast cancer awareness in South Asian Muslim women pre-mammography age (29-49&#x000a0;years). The focus was to see how South Asian women conceptualised their beliefs in relation to healthy breast awareness and to determine the role of religion and body image in intention to be breast aware.</p><p id="__p3089">Women (mean age 37&#x000a0;years) were recruited through mosques and community forums in the UK . They completed a brief questionnaire looking at constructs from the Health Belief Model (Champion, 1999), body image and religiosity.</p><p id="__p3090">Results showed that higher religiosity was associated with the following: greater perceived barriers to both breast cancer awareness and mammography screening, reduced confidence in breast self awareness, and less perceived benefits in mammography. In contrast positive body image was found to have a positive impact on breast health motivation, breast cancer awareness and finding out more about breast cancer. Good breast cancer awareness was associated with higher perceived benefits and lower barriers as expected. Examination of the predictors of intention to self-examination showed that higher body image and educational level had a positive impact on confidence, although no direct relationship to intentions.</p><p id="__p3091">The findings indicate that the constructs of the health belief model are relevant for South Asian Muslim women. Issues around body image and religiosity are important to acknowledge in building up confidence for breast cancer awareness in order to improve the likelihood of behavioral actions. The role of religion does not have a direct impact on actions but may inhibit development of positive beliefs systems about breast cancer awareness and mammography. This is particularly important for second generation South Asian women nearing the age for screening.</p><p id="__p3092">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anna Baker, PhD, London Metropolitan, London, E1 7NT; a.baker@londonmet.ac.uk</p><p id="__p3093">PST-156</p><p id="__p3094">AN EASY AND QUICK SCREENING FOR EARLY ALZHEIMER DISEASE</p><p id="__p3095">Shinya Takeda, MA,<sup>1</sup> Kayo Tajime, MD<sup>2</sup> and Kazuyuki Nakagome, MD, PhD<sup>3</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3096"><sup>1</sup>Department of Clinical Psychology, Tottori University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Yonago, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Department of Psychiatry, Tottori Seikyo Hospital, Tottori, Japan and <sup>3</sup>Division of Brain and Neuroscience, Department of Neuropsychiatry, Tottori University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Yonago, Japan.</p><p id="__p3097">In this study, we developed the Takeda Three Colors Combination Test (TTCC) as a simplified screening test for early detection of AD and examined its effectiveness. 166 senior persons participated in the research; 91 with mild AD and 75 healthy volunteers represented the control group. The TTCC, which is a colored cards configuration memory task, was examined for sensitivity and specificity as well as reliability and validity. The sensitivity of the TTCC in detecting mild AD was 84% with a specificity of 87%. The positive predictive value was 89%, the negative predictive value was 82% and the predictive accuracy was 86%. The odds ratio of the incorrect response to TTCC with control group as a standard was 32.0 (95%CI,13.1-78.1, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) for mild AD group. Including the results of the re-tests, the Phi coefficient indicated 0.76 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and the consistency percentage between first and second trials was 88%.

Conducting the TTCC (including instruction and evaluation) was accomplished within 2 minutes for all subjects. No refusal or resistance to this test was observed among any of the subjects. The TTCC has proven to be of adequate sensitivity and specificity as a screening test for early detection of AD. Furthermore, administration time is short and requires no special training or skills. Thus, we believe the TTCC shows great potential for use as an AD screening test by a general practitioner in communities worldwide.</p><p id="__p3098">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Shinya Takeda, MA, Department of Clinical Psychology, Tottori University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Yonago, 683-8503; takedas@med.tottori-u.ac.jp</p><p id="__p3099">PST-157</p><p id="__p3100">WHY AFRICAN-AMERICANS DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN COLON CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH</p><p id="__p3101">Anuli Njoku, MPH,<sup>1</sup> Desiree Burgh, MEd,<sup>1</sup> Melissa DiCarlo, MPH,<sup>1</sup> Nancy Brisbon, MD,<sup>2</sup> Randa Sifri, MD<sup>2</sup> and Ronald E.

As a result, African-Americans have higher CRC incidence and mortality than other racial/ethnic groups. Although research studies are underway to learn how to increase CRC screening, African-American participation in such studies is limited. Little is known about factors that influence African-American participation in CRC screening research studies.</p><p id="__p3104">Objective: To understand reasons that influence African-American participation in a study designed to increase CRC screening in primary care.</p><p id="__p3105">Methods: As part of a larger randomized, controlled behavioral intervention, we administered a baseline telephone survey to 134 African-American primary care patients ages 50 to 79.

We found substantial barriers by sex and geography, including urban residents received screenings during annual check-ups, while rural residents received screenings in response to symptoms. Of the 57 total barriers reported, four barriers were unique to urban Latino/Hispanic residents; and 13 barriers were unique to rural Latino/Hispanic residents. Low levels of health literacy, knowledge and awareness of CRC risk and screening were reported barriers across groups. The family unit and strong social support were also factors reported as influencing their CRC screening behavior. Participants identified barriers to CRC screening that fit into five categories: (a) physical environment, (b) structural factors, (c) sociocultural factors, (d) individual factors, and (e) physician-related barriers. Latino/Hispanic participants also identified potential strategies to overcome each reported barrier.

Approximately half of CRC deaths could be prevented if screening were consistently implemented. The Transtheoretical Model postulates that behavior change occurs over time with people moving through stages of readiness to adopt the behavior. The aims of this study were to: 1) examine distribution across stages of readiness to screen for CRC among African American primary care patients; and 2) determine whether demographic and health belief variables predict stage of readiness to screen. Baseline data were collected via telephone interviews from 311 patients who were due for screening and enrolled in a RCT testing efficacy of a computer-based intervention designed to increase CRC screening. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to examine demographic variables and Health Belief Model constructs (perceived risk, benefits, barriers and self-efficacy) as predictors of stage of readiness to screen for CRC. The sample was 56% male and a mean age of 58&#x000a0;years. For FOBT, 51.8% of patients were precontemplators, 37% were contemplators, and 11.3% were in preparation. Those at more advanced stages of readiness to screen with FOBT were male (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.49; 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.20, 5.53), had a lower BMI (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.96, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.93,0.99), higher perceived risk for CRC (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.43, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.10,1.87), lower perceived barriers to FOBT(OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53,0.98) and higher perceived self-efficacy for FOBT (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.27; 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.45,3.55). For colonoscopy, 39.7% were precontemplators, 51.6% were contemplators, and 8.7% were in preparation. Those at more advanced stages for colonoscopy had higher perceived risk for CRC (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.29, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.99, 1.68), higher perceived benefits of colonoscopy (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.62, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.18, 2.22) and higher self-efficacy for colonoscopy (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.71, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17, 2.51). Receipt of a recommendation from their provider was the most significant predictor of advanced stage for both FOBT (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.16, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.63, 6.59) and colonoscopy (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.90, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.85, 4.55). About half were thinking about being screened for CRC, with more considering colonoscopy than FOBT. Results provide evidence for strategies to move patients to action. Computer-based interventions that incorporate these strategies have great potential to move primary care patients forward in their stage of readiness to screen for CRC.</p><p id="__p3120">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Susan M.

A number of cancer patients in palliative care have oral health problems. A tool, in French, was developed to guide nurses in the care of these patients. After a literature review, 17 oral health problems and their corresponding clinical signs (67 in total) were identified. The aim of this study is to present the content validity of the tool.</p><p id="__p3126">Method. A dentist and three general practitioners in palliative care in Quebec (Canada) were invited to evaluate the relevance and sufficiency of each of the clinical signs identified. The relative importance of clinical signs was also assessed for certain oral health problems. As suggested by Polit, Tatano Beck and Owen (2007), an I-CVI of at least .75 was used to conclude about the relevance of a given clinical sign.</p><p id="__p3127">Findings. The I-CVI was satisfactory for 62 of 67 clinical signs. There was disagreement between the experts concerning the relevance of using pain/burning pain of mucosa and pain/burning pain of tongue to detect both pseudomembranous candidiasis and erythematous candidiasis. Opinions were also shared concerning the use of tooth sensitivity to cold and that of nearby tissues as a clinical sign of pulpitis and dental abscess. Finally, the experts considered that some clinical signs were more important than others to detect erythematous candidiasis, hyperplasic candidiasis, mucositis/stomatite, infections of viral origin and xerostomia. Thus, it will be necessary to develop a scoring method that takes this aspect into account.</p><p id="__p3128">Conclusion. The content validity of most of the clinical signs is satisfactory. Only minor adjustments to the tool are necessary. The next step is to demonstrate the convergent validity of the tool.</p><p id="__p3129">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Camille Gagn&#x000e9;, PhD, Faculty of nursing, Laval university, Quebec, QC, G1V 0A6; camille.gagne@fsi.ulaval.ca\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583830358096" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figw_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figw_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figw_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583830358096" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p3130">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sonia Suchday, PhD, Clinical Psychology Ph.D. (Health Emphasis) Program, Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, 10461; Sonia.Suchday@einstein.yu.edu</p><p id="__p3131">PST-160</p><p id="__p3132">SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, SUBJECTIVE SOCIAL CLASS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN JAPAN AND THE US</p><p id="__p3133">Norito Kawakami, MD, Maki Umeda, MPH, Keiko Sakurai, MPH and World Mental Health Japan Survey Group, None</p><p id="__p3134">School of Public Health, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.</p><p id="__p3135">Aims: Investigating the gradient of mental health along social class among countries with different social and cultural background might contribute to the further understanding of social class disparity in mental health.

Socioeconomic status, generally defined by factors such as income, education and occupation, can be measured subjectively via-self report using a scale representing a ten rung ladder. Recently, subjective SES has shown to be more predictive of health and cardiac outcomes than actual SES. Vital exhaustion (VE) is another risk factor associated with CVD and is characterized by feelings of excessive fatigue and demoralization, as well as in increase in irritability. To our knowledge, socioeconomic differences, both subjective and objective, with respect to VE, have not been explored. Therefore, the current study examined the associations between subjective SES and VE among cardiac patients.</p><p id="__p3157">Methods: A sample of 119 cardiac patients was recruited from hospitals and an associated private cardiology practice in New York City. The sample comprised of 45.4% women and the mean age was 59 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.63). Subjective SES was assessed using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective SES and VE was assessed using the Maastricht Questionnaire (revised scale version).</p><p id="__p3158">Results: Mean score on VE was 47 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;16.89). Within the community comparison of social standing, the mean score was 7.08 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.78) and within the USA comparison of social standing the mean score was 5.91 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.89). Vital exhaustion was negatively correlated with both community comparison (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.29, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and USA comparison of social standing (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.31, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Subjective SES compared to others in the U.S., but not others within the community, was an independent predictor of vital exhaustion when controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, and age (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.22, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03). These negative associations have implications for identifying a population at risk for heart disease.</p><p id="__p3159">Conclusion: Our findings indicate that among U.S. cardiac patients, perception of social standing is associated with being Vitally Exhausted.

Nevertheless, our society seems to refuse everything that could be related to illness, suffering and death. Daily we overhear news about unexpected deaths, which highlights the importance of being aware of one&#x02019;s death as a part of the cycle of life. The aim of this study was to analyze the main factors that could help to face the own death from young people&#x02019;s perspective. The sample was made up of 60 young people, aged between 18 and 27. All participants were evaluated by the &#x0201c;Helping to Die in Peace Questionnaire&#x0201d; (CAMP) by Bay&#x000e9;s et al., (2000), which is composed of two major items. The first one assesses the aspects that could help people to die in peace, answering to eleven sentences according to a 5 points scale. In relation to the second one, participants have to select the two most important factors when death is close, through the eleven previous statements. Results showed the following factors as the most relevant to young people: &#x0201c;Being able to be close, communicate and strengthen my bonds with loved ones&#x0201d; (X&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,1; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0,8), &#x0201c;To think that my life has had some meaning&#x0201d; (X&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,0; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,1), &#x0201c;To think that my death won&#x02019;t cause an unbearable burden to loved ones&#x0201d; (X&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,9; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,1). On the other hand, the less important aspects were: &#x0201c;Believing in other life after death&#x0201d; (X&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,5; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,5), &#x0201c;To think that I may die at home&#x0201d; (X&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,8; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,3), &#x0201c;To think that my dying process will be short in case of suffering&#x0201d; (X&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,3; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,4) and &#x0201c;Not to feel guilty about past personal conflicts&#x0201d; (X&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,3; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,4). The rest of the items reached intermediate values.

Moreover, only little research has been done to examine the pathway through which SI affects health. Therefore we analysed the mediating effect of effort-reward imbalance at work (ERI) on this association. METHODS: Analyses were based on a random sample of 1111 male employees (25-64&#x000a0;years) from the south-west of Germany. Data were collected by a telephone interview in 2008/09. Information on socio-demographic variables, social status indicators (education, occupational grade and income), occupational strain (ERI), and physical as well as mental health (SF-12) were given. RESULTS: SI was significantly associated to low mental health, both directly and, consistent to our hypothesis, indirectly via low rewards. As SI was also related to low effort, no association was found for the quotient of both scales (ERI) and mental health. The effect of SI on physical health was entirely mediated by low rewards without any direct effect. The inclusion of further risk factors (age, BMI) did not attenuate these Results: CONCLUSION: SI is significantly associated to ill health. Moreover, results indicate that at least a part of this relationship is explained by low rewards at work, findings with implications for further research in job strain and health inequality.</p><p id="__p3182">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Stefanie Braig, MA, Institute of Epidemiology, Ulm University, Ulm, 89069; stefanie.braig@uni-ulm.de</p><p id="__p3183">PST-168b</p><p id="__p3184">SOCIAL ADAPTATION AND DEPRESSION</p><p id="__p3185">Heather Glubo, BA,<sup>1</sup> Hillary Lewin, BA,<sup>1</sup> Maureen Almeida, MA, MPhil,<sup>2</sup> Sonia Suchday, PhD<sup>1</sup> and Pejman Sehatpour, MD, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3186"><sup>1</sup>Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, New York, NY and <sup>2</sup>St Xaviers College, Mumbai, India.</p><p id="__p3187">Selection of a spouse reflects the cultural values of society. Spouse selection in the west is based primarily on falling-in-love whereas in India, selecting a spouse has been traditionally arranged. As a result of globalization, western influence in India is on the rise requiring a traditional society to modify its cultural norms. While arranged marriage is still prevalent in India, a new mode of marriage, love marriage, is becoming increasingly common. This transition introduces new social stressors, which may impact health. We hypothesize that traditional individuals will feel conflicted by the shift in cultural norms toward a more non-traditional system and possibly experience symptoms of depression. To test the hypothesis, a group of 350 college students in Mumbai, a major metropolis of India undergoing rapid cultural change in recent years were surveyed. We administered questionnaires measuring the influence exerted by tradition on mate selection and its health impact. Logistic regression analysis determined that traditional influence predicted the choice of arranged marriage (% Variance accounted for&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.25; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.005). Thus traditional individuals are more likely to choose an arranged marriage. Based on our hypothesis these individuals would be more vulnerable to cultural shifts and manifest symptoms of depression more than those choosing love marriages. The Mann-Whitney test results indicated significantly (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.04) higher depression among individuals who chose arrange marriage. These results suggest that traditional individuals are more susceptible to feeling dysphoric secondary to the cultural changes taking place in urban India. This discontent could impact their health.</p><p id="__p3188">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Heather Glubo, BA, Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, New York, NY, 10028; heatherglubo@gmail.com</p><p id="__p3189">PST-168c</p><p id="__p3190">WEALTH, HEALTH AND SPIRITUALITY</p><p id="__p3191">Hillary Lewin, MA,<sup>1</sup> Heather Glubo, MA,<sup>1</sup> Maureen Almeida, MA,<sup>2</sup> Pejman Sehatpour, PhD, MBBS<sup>1</sup> and Sonia Suchday, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3192"><sup>1</sup>Psychology, Yeshiva University, New York, NY and <sup>2</sup>Psychology, St. Xavier&#x02019;s College, Mumbai, India.</p><p id="__p3193">Subjective socioeconomic status (SES) impacts health independently of objective SES. However, little is known about variables that contribute to perception of social standing other than objective SES, which is only modestly correlated with subjective SES. Spirituality also impacts on health and may synergistically interact with perceived SES to predict health. It is hypothesized that Subjective SES will correlate positively with Spirituality. And spirituality and subjective SES will predict health outcomes after controlling for objective SES. Urban college students (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;568; Mean Age: 19&#x000a0;years; 73.1% Female; Religion: 46.3% Christian; 37.3% Hindu; Other: 16.4%) in Mumbai, India completed questionnaires on Spiritual Well-Being (SWB) measuring Existential (EWB) and Religious Well-Being (RWB), somatic symptoms (CHIPS), subjective SES and objective SES. Results indicated that objective SES and subjective SES were positively but modestly correlated (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.20, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). There was a negative relationship between objective SES and SWB, RWB and CHIPS (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.11, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05; -.20, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001; -.10, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05, respectively) and between subjective SES and RWB and CHIPS (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.12, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.005; -.20, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001, respectively). These data indicate that high SES - perceived and actual - is associated with lower engagement in prayer and relationship with a higher spiritual power and with fewer somatic symptoms than low SES. There was no correlation found between objective SES and EWB and subjective SES and EWB were positively correlated (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.20, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) indicating that perceived social standing is associated with life satisfaction and stability. These data indicate the complexity of variables that contribute to material and spiritual well-being and its interaction with health where subjectively poor people engage more in religious practice and do not experience existential satisfaction and report more somatic symptoms.</p><p id="__p3194">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hillary Lewin, MA, Hillary Lewin, Yeshiva University, New York, NY, 10024; hillary.lewin@gmail.com</p><p id="__p3195">PST-168d</p><p id="__p3196">PROJECT GATHER: CAN HEALTH CARE PERCEPTIONS FACILITATE DECISIONS OF A MULTI-ETHNIC SAMPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A GENETIC BIOBANK?</p><p id="__p3197">Marissa C.

The predicted periods of the ambulatory BP monitoring were 24-hours, morning, evening, and night. The participants were 95 healthy men with different BP levels from the Tampere Ambulatory Blood Pressure Study. The participants could be treated as one group, because the diagnostic BPs were normally distributed. The measures of social support were the total score of the Interview for Social Interaction (ISSI; Henderson, Byrne, &#x00026; Duncan-Jones, 1981) and five subscales of it. The first sets in the hierarchical regression analysis had the respective diagnostic values of BP and HR as predictors. These were all significant predictors of daily cardiovascular measures as expected. In the second series of sets, the total score of ISSI and the subscale scores of it were added to the models, respectively. The prediction of ambulatory cardiovascular measures improved by up to 3% by adding the Adequacy of Social Integration (ADSI), a subscale of ISSI to the diagnostic SBPs. In conclusion, one specific measure of social support, the Adequacy of Social Integration (but not others) improved the prediction of cardiovascular measures in daily life. These results are in line with previous findings emphasizing the function of the quality of social support as a buffer in daily life.</p><p id="__p3209">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lauri Parkkinen, MSc, Department of Extension Studies, University of Tampere, Halikko as, 24910; parkkinen.lauri@gmail.com</p><p id="__p3210">PST-168f</p><p id="__p3211">LOWER EDUCATION LEVELS AND HIGHER SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SBP) IN THE NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH (ADD HEALTH)</p><p id="__p3212">Beverly H.

Hypertension, 2010) suggest that central adiposity and heart rate account for a sizable amount of the inverse association between individual education and SBP in a French cohort: body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference explained 28% and resting heart rate, 15% of this association. Psychological factors and health behaviors also helped account for the education-SBP association, but to a much smaller degree. We used data on a nationally representative U.S. sample of 15,701 young adult participants aged 24-32&#x000a0;years in Add Health, Wave IV, to determine whether a similar education-SBP association exists in a U.S. cohort and to examine several potential mediators of it. Individual education level was associated with SBP (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) as follows: Some high school or less, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;1212, SBP&#x02009;=&#x02009;126.0&#x02009;+&#x02009;14.1(S.D.)mmHg; Graduated high school, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;2453, SBP&#x02009;=&#x02009;126.6&#x02009;+&#x02009;13.9&#x000a0;mmHg; Some college or vocational tech, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;6710, SBP&#x02009;=&#x02009;124.7&#x02009;+&#x02009;13.8&#x000a0;mmHg; Bachelors degree, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;2942, SBP&#x02009;=&#x02009;123.2&#x02009;+&#x02009;13.1&#x000a0;mmHg, and; Graduate school or more, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;1845, SBP&#x02009;=&#x02009;122.0&#x02009;+&#x02009;12.7&#x000a0;mmHg. When the education-SBP association was adjusted for BMI, the 4.0&#x000a0;mmHg difference in SBP between the lowest and highest education groups was reduced to 2.7&#x000a0;mmHg. Further adjustment for gender, race/ethnicity, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, marital status, employment status, income, presence of financial strain and home ownership reduced the SBP difference to 0.6&#x000a0;mmHg. These findings replicate in a U.S. cohort the finding in a French cohort of a robust association between lower education level and increased SBP. In the larger Add Health sample, this association was nearly completely accounted for by BMI, race/ethnicity, gender, marital status and lifestyle characteristics.

This research proposes that self esteem, a key dispositional factor will reduce perceived stress for African Americans. Further, effective coping strategies may moderate the impact of self esteem on stress.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 561 workers. The workers were invited to fill in a self-administered questionnaire exploring their socio-demographic characteristics, occupational stress levels, and 12-item general health questionnaire. A hierarchical multiple regression procedure was used to assess the effects of occupational stress on mental health. RESULTS: After controlling for age, educational level, marital status and years of off-shore work, poor mental health was found to have a significant positive association with seven of the nine identified sources of occupational stress. They were: conflict between job and family/social life, poor development of career and achievement at work, safety problems at work, management problems and poor relationship with others at work, poor physical environment of the work place, uncomfortable ergonomic factors at work, and poor organizational structure at work. All of these occupational stress sources together explained 19.9% of the total variance. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed that occupational stress was a major risk factor for poor mental health among industrial workers. Reducing or eliminating occupational stressors at work would benefit workers&#x02019; mental health in developing country like Nepal.

Method: Subjects went through fMRI scanning while observing Neutral Pictures, Emotional Pictures and then practiced breathing control (Exp Group) or no breathing control (Control group). Results: (a) Aversive pictures activated left amygdale and right insula in the control group.

This form of meditation is rooted in Buddhist Vipassana and Zen practices, and involves moment-by-moment, detached awareness and observation of the continually changing field of perception and its contents. Albeit the interest to verify the clinical efficacy of mindfulness practice has grown considerably in the last years, its specific psychobiological profile has been scarcely investigated, particularly with respect to the immune system, and this research does not seem to have been conducted, integratively, in clinical population. Thus, the present study was carried out to examine the effects of a mindfulness meditation program on immune parameters in a clinical sample. 16 patients with depression and anxiety symptoms participated in the study; these patients underwent a mindfulness meditation program for the period of eight weeks. For the quantification of immune parameters (leucocytes, immunoglobulins and complement), blood samples were taken before and at the end of the training program. T-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed as statistical analyses. After completing the mindfulness meditation program, patients displayed significantly lower levels of monocytes and IgM, and higher levels of C3 and C4, as compared with pre-training. Therefore, these results show that mindfulness meditation may exert a significant immunomodulatory action in anxious and depressed patients, which may hold clinical relevance. Future studies should confirm these findings, as well as fully assess their clinical implications.</p><p id="__p3253">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Juan M.

Similarities between the neurochemical, endocrine, and behavioral consequences of immune challenge and stressors have been described frequently but the impact of immune stimulation such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or stressors on central or peripheral IL-1&#x003b2; has not been systematically explored. To establish whether treatment of LPS or exposure to the foot shock stress (FS) leads to a changes in central or peripheral production of IL-1&#x003b2; and what types of cells express IL-1&#x003b2; in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and hippocampus were investigated in rats.

Despite disparities in cardiovascular disease prevalence, especially hypertension, researchers have also suggested that African Americans (AA) actually display greater resting HRV compared to Whites (Li et al., 2009). One proposed explanation for the greater rates of hypertension in African Americans is a greater peripheral resistance in the systemic vasculature (Dorr et al., 2007). In the present study, we sought to examine the relationships among HRV, and central (i.e. Cardiac Output|CO) and peripheral (i.e. Total Peripheral Resistance|TPR) hemodynamic measures. As part of a larger study, continuous measurements of HRV and hemodynamics were obtained for 34 AA participants (22 females, Mage&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.8, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.7), during a five minute resting baseline period. Initial correlational analysis revealed a moderate association between resting HRV and resting CO(r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.29, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.08). Analyses were then conducted separately for each gender. Interestingly, this association was stronger for AA females (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.47, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02), but weaker and in the opposite direction for AA males (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.09, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.79). Separate analyses also revealed a strong relationship between resting HRV and TPR in AA men (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.60, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04), that was not observed for AA women (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.13, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.61). In follow-up regression analysis the effect for AA women was attenuated when BMI was added to the model; results for men were not diminished when controlling for age and BMI. These results suggest that important gender differences may modify the association between autonomic nervous system activity and hemodynamic parameters associated with cardiovascular disease.</p><p id="__p3265">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: LaBarron K.

To investigate the relationships of SOC scores to perceived health status and job stress, self-administered questionnaires were distributed 1968 workers in some industries. Complete answers were recovered from 295 workers (14.9%, 192 males and 103 females) and used for the analysis(179 office clerks, 28 sales representatives, 21 technical engineers, and 67 others). Work stressors, psychological and somatic responses, social support, and job satisfaction were assessed by Brief Questionnaire for Job Stress (BQJS). Perceived health were evaluated by asking subjects to give 1-4 points to their own status (1 very healthy, 2 rather healthy, 3 not so healthy, 4 unhealthy). Ages were 49.3&#x000a0;years on average (SD11.4)for all respondents, and were 50.7 (SD 11.6) and 46.4(SD 10.7) for males and females, respectively. SOC scores were 56.8(SD6.1)on average, without significant differences between two genders (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).

Similarly, in males, depression scores (BQJS) were related inversely to SOC, job satisfaction and supervisor&#x02019;s support, and positively to job load and stress by human relations (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The similar relationships of depression scores to job load, supervisor&#x02019;s support and stress by human relations were observed in females (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Perceived health was not significantly associated with SOC scores in the multiple regression analysis (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). It is thus suggested that SOC can reduce adverse responses to job stress(job load and stress by human relations).</p><p id="__p3271">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Kayoko Urakawa, PhD, MA, RN, Stress Science, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, 514-8507; adiemus@nurse.medic.mie-u.ac.jp</p><p id="__p3272">PST-178</p><p id="__p3273">SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE IN A POPULATION BASED SAMPLE.

Saliva samples were collected at awakening, 30 minutes after awakening and just before going to bed. sAA was measured by a calorimetric method using Phadebas amylase test. Linear regression models were used to test associations between sAA levels and a broad spectrum of psychosocial factors (e.g. depressive symptamology, vital exhaustion, mastery and sense of coherence) self rated health and inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein).

Evidence regarding the directionality of the depression-inflammation relationship is equivocal however, and indicative of possible complex and bidirectional associations. Methods: At the time of their index event (baseline), and then again 1- and 3-months later, 163 post-Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a measure of depression symptom severity with cognitive and somatic components. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was also assessed at these visits, as were known correlates of depression and CRP (i.e., age, sex, body mass index, education, race-ethnicity, mean arterial pressure [MAP], smoking status, history of rheumatic disease, and history of diabetes). Path analyses were conducted to evaluate the directionality of the depression-CRP relation and whether directionality varied by sex and/or specific symptom dimensions of depression. Results: Baseline total depression symptom severity predicted an increase in CRP from baseline to 1-month (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) controlling for all covariates, as did baseline cognitive-affective depression symptom severity (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). In contrast, baseline somatic-vegetative depression symptom severity did not predict an increase in CRP (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.01, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92). CRP did not significantly predict 1- or 3-month change in total, cognitive-affective, or somatic-vegetative depression symptom severity. Results did not differ for men and women. Conclusion: Cognitive-affective and total depression symptom severity at the time of a cardiac event predicted 1-month increases in CRP for both men and women, but there was no evidence that earlier CRP predicts later depression symptoms.</p><p id="__p3286">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jonathan A.

Eight saliva samples were collected from the participants for two days at specific times after waking: immediately, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, and 12 hours. Cortisol data of the two days were aggregated for analysis. The two components of diurnal rhythm, namely, awakening response and diurnal decline were examined separately. For the cortisol awakening response, two separate indices reflecting the mean level of secretion and the rise from immediately to 45 minutes post-awakening, AUCG and AUCI, were computed using the trapezoid formula. Similar procedure was applied to arrive at two indices of decline: AUCG-d and AUCI-d, from the peak level in the morning to that of 12 hours post-awakening. The relation of each of the two indices within each diurnal component to the availability, use and development of social network was examined in a multiple regression analysis while controlling for the effect of gender, age, socioeconomic status, waking time, humor, and self-esteem. Results indicated that higher scores in social network development were associated with a steeper rise in the morning (Beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;.32, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.24, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and a faster decline over the day (Beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;.34, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.38, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Participants having higher scores on this variable exhibited a stronger motivation to develop and extend their social relationships. Its effect on cortisol might stem from the positivity underlying the intention, which is consistent with what prior data suggest. None of the other variables included in the regression analysis had significant impact on cortisol levels. Findings of the present study suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is the major pathway whereby positive psychosocial factors exert their health effects in the aging population.</p><p id="__p3292">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Julian C.

Fifty-seven male and female students (mean age 21.4&#x000a0;yrs.) were subjected to the psychosocial stress test "Trier Social Stress Test" (TSST), in which the participants were asked to deliver a speech and perform a mental arithmetic in front of two audiences. Saliva samples were taken before, during, and after TSST. Salivary IL-6 and CRP concentrations significantly increased by an average of 71% and 56%, respectively, compared to each baseline value. Both concentrations peaked during stress tasks and IL-6 and CRP levels remained elevated for 20 and 10 minutes, respectively, after the cessation of stress tasks. IL-6 response was moderately correlated to CRP response (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.305, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05).

This study examined whether frequent church attendance is related to disease progression markers (CD4 and Viral Load (VL)) over time in people with HIV, and whether these effects may be independent of spirituality. Methods: One hundred diverse participants with HIV (men, women, African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic) answered questions about church attendance and spirituality as part of a psychosocial battery. Participants were followed every 6&#x000a0;months for CD4 and VL changes over 4&#x000a0;years. Hierarchical Linear Modeling assessed whether frequency of church attendance was associated with slope changes in CD4 or VL (log) over time controlling for baseline CD4, VL, age, gender, ethnicity, education, and spirituality. Results: Church attendance was significantly associated with slower CD4 decline (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.52 p =.001) but not VL. Note that the impact of church attendance was significant even above spirituality.

Recently, it is thought that the salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR) can serve as a reliable marker of HPA axis to respond to stress. The CAR is greater in people under chronic work stress and on the work day than the weekend. We recently demonstrated that the difference on this weekday and weekends is an adequate responsiveness to adapt to stress. However, there are no studies that investigate the relationship between the CAR and loneliness on the work days and the weekends in women. The present study was to investigate the relationship between the CAR and loneliness on the work days and the weekends in women.</p><p id="__p3342">Methods: The participants were healthy 90 women (20-50&#x000a0;years old). Loneliness was evaluated using the revised UCLA loneliness scale (Russell et al., 1980) and participants were classified into high (average&#x02009;+&#x02009;1SD) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) or low loneliness groups (average - 1SD) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13). The saliva samples were collected over the work days and the weekends. Participants were instructed to collect saliva on six occasions each day: before sleep, immediately on awakening, 30 minutes after awakening, and then as near as possible to 10:00&#x000a0;am, 12:00&#x000a0;pm, and 3:00&#x000a0;pm.</p><p id="__p3343">Results: CAR was larger on weekends in the high loneliness group than the low loneliness group.

Weight gain prevention interventions have shown to be feasible within the occupational health services, but are hardly being implemented by occupational physicians (OPs) due to a lack of methods and materials. The aim of this study is to 1) develop, 2) evaluate, and 3) implement a weight gain prevention guideline to be used by OPs. Following the standard template of the Netherlands Society of Occupational Medicine and using the Intervention Mapping protocol, a draft guideline was developed based on literature, interviews with employers, OPs and employees, input from an external project group consisting of OPs and lifestyle experts, and input from independent lifestyle experts. Based on all sources mentioned above, the developed guideline consists of clear cut recommendations for OPs to 1) advise employers to promote employees&#x02019; physical activity and diet and 2) counsel employees to adopt a physically active and healthy diet behaviour. Tools to implement recommendations consist of a minimal intervention strategy to counsel employees, and a scan to assess the obesogenic environment. The guideline is now being evaluated in a RCT among 30 OPs and 350 employees. If proven effective, this weight gain prevention guideline will be implemented on a larger scale within the occupational health services in the Netherlands.</p><p id="__p3365">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lisanne M.

The Wagner&#x02019;s chronic care model suggests that self-management support needs to be embedded in the system. Coote suggests that co-production can be applied to health care. It is a model in which true partnership is based on the active input of recipients in the provision of their own care however it is at best &#x02018;too flexible&#x02019; to guide practice.</p><p id="__p3371">Aims: To define the key observable behaviours that clinicians and patients require for co-productive interactions in LTC consultations.</p><p id="__p3372">Methods: A convenient sample of eleven UK and US experts in self-management support and communication skills were interviewed for an hour using a semi-structured format. The transcripts were analyzed thematically.</p><p id="__p3373">Results: Clinicians and patients need to enter in a partnership, recognizing mutual expertise within a long term relationship; consultations should include discussions about self-management strategies used to develop a highly personalized solution; shared decision making should develop e.g. over health priorities. This means negotiating an agenda, setting goals and agreeing in a follow-up; the development of rapport is important to engage patients in behaviour change and co-production of health requires a system that facilitates joint decision making. The final model will help to develop a measurement tool using the Roter Interaction Analysis System to assess co-production of health in video-recordings of real life clinician-patient consultations across the UK.</p><p id="__p3374">Discussion: This study adds to the understanding of clinical practices and communication behaviours in consultations for people with LTC. The results will be submitted to a further e-Delphi consultation process with the same experts (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) and also a wider group of health care professionals to reach a reasonable level of agreement and to confirm the model.</p><p id="__p3375">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Alba Realpe, MSc, Coventry University, UK, Coventry, CV1 5FB; A.Realpe@coventry.ac.uk</p><p id="__p3376">PST-183</p><p id="__p3377">TRANSLATING FAMILY HEALTH PROGRAM HEALTH PROFESSIONAL PERCEPTIONS TO IMPROVE CHILD HEALTH IN VESPASIANO, BRAZIL</p><p id="__p3378">Lilian Perez, MPH,<sup>1</sup> Priscila Saleme, MD Candidate,<sup>2</sup> Bernardo Patrus, MD Candidate,<sup>2</sup> Jose A.

Several studies have pointed to the impacts of the FHP on improving child survival in Brazil. Few studies, however, have examined the mechanisms underlying the successful delivery of services in the community, particularly from the perspectives of the health professionals. The goal of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the perceptions of FHP professionals of Vespasiano, Brazil on training, workplace challenges, and practices for child health. This cross-sectional study involved interviews with 77 professionals using a mixed-methods approach. Data was double-entered and analyzed in Epi Info version 3.5.1. Open-ended responses were stratified by professional category, translated from Portuguese to English, and analyzed using a thematic coding approach. The results show that 92% of professionals received training in their first 12&#x000a0;months in the program but the majority found the training was limited in quantity, content, methods of delivery, and overall quality. Challenges in the workplace include insufficient government support, poor infrastructure, and lack of resources. In spite of these limitations, over 70% of CHWs reported promoting important health messages to caretakers and 87% of professionals were satisfied with the FHP child diarrhea services. In addition, the majority of professionals perceived the FHP is created for the needs of the community (83%) and is accepted by the users (81%). Translation of this research will be important for policies and program developments to improve on the limitations and promote the strengths of the FHP in order to advance Brazil&#x02019;s healthcare model to address leading causes of disease among the Brazilian pediatric population</p><p id="__p3381">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lilian Perez, MPH, Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, 30306; lgperez12@gmail.com</p><p id="__p3382">PST-184</p><p id="__p3383">THE HEALTH IMPACT OF CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT: HEALTH VARIABLES IN RELATION TO OFFICIAL AND SELF REPORT DATA</p><p id="__p3384">Angela Maia, phd and Ricardo Pinto, dr</p><p id="__p3385">Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.</p><p id="__p3386">Aims: Childhood maltreatment had been considered a risk factor for psychopathology and health problems, including health complaints, health risk behaviors and diseases. Studies usually use retrospective methodologies and clinical samples. However, some authors have been discussing the validity of the associations these studies usually found suggesting that recall bias can explain the relation between maltreatment and symptoms. The aim of this study was to characterize current psychological and health functioning in young adults that were victims of maltreatment as children and compare the self report with official records from Child Protection Services.</p><p id="__p3387">Method: Official records of 109 young adults that were identified as victims by protection services during childhood (55 female and 54 male) were compared with self-reported maltreatment history data using Childhood History Questionnaire. Participants also filled Brief Symptoms Inventory and Rotterdam Symptoms Checklist.</p><p id="__p3388">Results: Subjects that report more adverse experiences have more psychopathology (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.48; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.000) and health complaints (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.36; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.000). Some subjects (21%) do not report any maltreatment experience, 36% report only some of the experiences they were victims and 44% do accurate reports. These groups are not different in relation to psychopathology (F(2, 104) = .618; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.541) or health complaints (&#x003c7;2(2) = 4.40; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.111)</p><p id="__p3389">Conclusion: Self-report false negatives for adverse childhood experiences are very high and most of the subject&#x02019;s don&#x02019;t report all the experiences they were victims. Some authors had suggested that the relation between reported childhood experiences and symptoms could be interpreted as a record bias for participants that are symptomatic in the evaluation moment, but this data does not confirm this hypothesis since there were no symptoms differences between the groups.

This study assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the 17-item Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), a self-report instrument, in the detection of HIV-related PTSD. An adapted version of the PTSD module of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) served as the gold standard.</p><p id="__p3396">Method: 85 HIV-positive patients diagnosed with HIV within the year preceding data collection were recruited by means of convenience sampling from three HIV clinics within primary health care facilities in the Boland region of South Africa.</p><p id="__p3397">Results: A significant association was found between the 17-item PDS and the adapted PTSD module of the CIDI.

However, one aspect of the environment along with its related area of scientific investigation and professional application, all with clear implications for health issues, has received less attention than is warranted. Specifically, we are referring to Interpersonal conflict as described by Contemporary Social Conflict Theory (CSCT), which is not well known or understood. The result is that Its implications for health issues are underestimated or ignored.</p><p id="__p3405">Conventional views equate conflict with behavior (arguing/fighting), view it as &#x0201c;bad,&#x0201d; and advocate avoidance as a response to prevent violence. CSCT views conflict as a cognitive process based on beliefs concerning needs and the expectations for satisfying them. Conflict, defined as &#x0201c;perceived divergence of interest&#x0201d; is regarded as inevitable, ubiquitous and necessary for change. For CSCT, contention (fighting) is one of five response modalities - accommodation, avoidance, compromise, and problem solving -- are the other &#x0201c;Conflict Management Styles (CMS&#x02019;s), each with predictable consequences.</p><p id="__p3406">Conventional views of conflict limit us to consideration of the contentious CMS which has implications for health ranging from covert effects of stress from using this CMS on a regular basis to overt effects of violence that can result from this CMS. However, other CMS&#x02019;s have implications for health outcomes, raising a variety of research questions, e.g., who gets better treatment, the demanding &#x0201c;contentious&#x0201d; patient or the compliant &#x0201c;accommodating&#x0201d; patient? Does an avoidant CMS result in lessened ability to address important health care issues with family or healthcare providers? Does a problem solving CMS result in proactive health behavior, better communication with HCP&#x02019;s, and higher rates of compliance?</p><p id="__p3407">The purpose of this poster is to explicate the principles and practices of CSCT and suggest their potential practical use - especially those involving decision making activities about treatment.</p><p id="__p3408">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Michael Van Slyck, PhD, Virginia Comonwealth University, Richmond, VA, 23282; mrvanslyck@vcu.edu</p><p id="__p3409">PST-187a</p><p id="__p3410">SPIRITUAL WELLBEING MEDIATES THE EFFECTS OF A PSYCHO-SPIRITUAL MANTRAM PROGRAM ON PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY IN VETERANS WITH MILITARY-RELATED PTSD</p><p id="__p3411">Jill E.

Little is known, however, about mechanisms for this improvement. Prior studies of the mantram intervention have demonstrated increased spiritual well-being (SWB) and decreased psychological distress attributable to this intervention. Therefore, we hypothesized that increases in SWB may mediate reductions in PTSD symptom severity.</p><p id="__p3414">Methods: Path analysis was conducted on data from a randomized clinical trial in which 66 Veterans with chronic military-related PTSD completed a 6-week (90-minutes/week) mantram group intervention and were compared to 70 usual care controls. The dependent variable was the pre- to post-treatment change scores on the PTSD Checklist (PCL). The mediator variable was the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy&#x02014;Spiritual Well-Being scale (FACIT-SWB). The sample was 97% male; 59% Caucasian, 24% African American, 7% Hispanic and 10% other. They ranged in age from 25 to 83 (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;57, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.26), averaged 14&#x000a0;years (SD = 2.1) of education and experienced an average of 13&#x000a0;months (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.0) of combat.</p><p id="__p3415">Results: The hypothesis that SWB partially mediates reductions in PTSD symptom severity was supported. The mantram intervention predicted post-treatment changes in PCL (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.71, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). There was a significant and positive, indirect effect in the path from the mantram intervention to SWB (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.37, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and a significant, negative effect from SWB to PCL (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;.32, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0002). Similar results were found using the Baron and Kenny statistical approach. The Sobel test was significant at 2.55 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01).</p><p id="__p3416">Conclusion: Findings suggest that one potential mechanism by which the mantram intervention reduces PTSD symptom severity in Veterans is by promoting beliefs about meaning and/or purpose in life and feelings of peace and harmony. Spiritual wellbeing may be an important factor to consider when treating PTSD.</p><p id="__p3417">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jill E.

One of them is the difficulty to establish a clear relationship between the experience of physical violence and health variables, mainly due to methodological issues.

The aim of this study was to describe the evolving RTW-process in a 5-year follow-up period after a 4-weeks inpatient occupational rehabilitation program.</p><p id="__p3434">Methods: The sample consisted of 584 patients (66% females, mean age 44&#x000a0;years [sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.3], long-term sick-listed; mean duration 9.3&#x000a0;months [sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.4] for psychological (47%) and musculoskeletal (46%) diagnosis. Register data from The National Insurance Administration in Norway over a 5-year follow-up period was analysed. Outcome was measured in an 8 state-model: working, part-time sick-listed, sick-listed, medical rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation, part-time disability pension, time-limited disability pension and permanent disability pension. Extended statistical tools for multistate models were used to calculate transition probabilities between the different states.</p><p id="__p3435">Results: During the 5-year follow-up period the patients had on average 4.6 [range 1-19] shifts between the 8 different states.

Aim of the study is to investigate the association between self-efficacy for RTW (SERTW) and: a. the intention to change, and b. RTW status, in a cohort of injured workers with work-related musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id="__p3443">Methods: A baseline telephone interview was conducted in 632 claimants one-month post-injury and 446 claimants (six-month post-injury). Return-to-Work Self-Efficacy (RTWSE) was measured with a validated questionnaire consisting of three subscales: RTWSE with regard to 1. Controlling pain at work; 2. Obtaining help from supervisor and 3. Obtaining help from co-workers. Intention to change was assessed with the validated Readiness for Return-To-Work (RRTW) Scale, reflecting closely the five stages described in the Readiness for RTW model [1,3]. RTW status was measured based on the workers&#x02019; responses to the question whether they returned to work at one- and six-month follow-up. ANOVA tests were conducted to compare relationships for each of the three RTWSE subscales with the stages of change and the RTW status.</p><p id="__p3444">Results: with regard to intention to change all univariate F-tests were significant at both measures in time, except for the co-worker RTWSE subscale at one-month follow-up. RTWSE is at its peak in workers who are actively preparing to return to work, however, it decreases significantly for people who start working again on all three RTWSE subscales. Comparing RTWSE with RTW status significant differences were found only for the Pain SERTW subscale at both time measures. Workers who returned to work showed higher Pain RTWSE scores compared to those who were still sick-listed.</p><p id="__p3445">Conclusion: a strong association between SE-RTW and Readiness for RTW stages was found, however the association between SE-RTW and RTW status was only strong for RTWSE.

Research has focused on pre-displacement trauma. However, many refugees find themselves unemployed or underemployed in their new country. Employment is known to be critical for social integration &#x00026; well-being. This study focuses on the relationship between post-displacement skills utilization among Iraqi refugees and health.</p><p id="__p3466">Methodology: Iraqis throughout the world were contacted using web-pages commonly used by Iraqis and by emails. Inclusion criteria were bachelor or above and having left Iraq as refugees 1990 or later. Potential participants were referred to a Monkey Survey Link, &#x00026; following consenting to the study, they responded to a survey with 34 questions concerning socio-demographic, employment, stress, psychosomatic, mental &#x00026; somatic complaints. All respondents (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;408) were classified according to employment status; Unemployed (G1, 42% of total), Professional working at their skills level (G2, 27%), &#x00026; Professionals working below their skills level (G3, 31%), representing 65 countries. Significant group differences are presented. WSU HIC approved the study.</p><p id="__p3467">Results: Participants in the G1 group rated their health the highest (Excellent to Good, 69%), versus 80% in G3, and 86% in G2. Stress, sleep difficulties, depression and psychosomatic symptoms were the highest in G1, intermediate in G3, &#x00026; the lowest in G2. 90% of G2 enjoyed their work significantly more as compared to G3 (10%). The major barriers to getting a job were: language, financial limitation for training, &#x00026; insufficient professional skills. Logistic regressions showed that G1 rated their health better versus unemployed (OR 2.6; 95% C.I. 1.4-5.2).

However, no such intervention exists for patients with acute hand injuries, while these injuries can be devastating and severely influence a person&#x02019;s ability to work. Regular rehabilitation interventions&#x02019; focus is on functional recovery of the hand, including tasks necessary to perform the job. However, also psychosocial and work-related factors influence RTW strongly. Therefore, we developed a psychosocial intervention for patients with acute hand injuries, aimed at to facilitate RTW in this population.</p><p id="__p3475">Methods: A combination of qualitative research techniques was used, comprising a mixture of literature study, survey, individual and focus group interviews with patients, rehabilitation practitioners and work counseling experts, and translation methodology.</p><p id="__p3476">Results: Some preliminary ideas about the nature of the intervention came to fore. The RTW intervention should: 1) take into account the acute character of the injury; 2) be short of duration; 3) be non-invasive, as most patients do not consider themselves sick; 4) be aimed at RTW; 5) reduce costs and therefore group sessions are favored.</p><p id="__p3477">Solution-Focused Therapy (SFT) met most of the aforementioned criteria. However, as SFT originates in family therapy, its principles and practices had to be translated to the problems of patients with acute hand injuries targeted on RTW. SFT therapists use a number of specific questioning techniques that invite clients to co-construct a vision of a preferred future and draw on their past successes, strengths, and resources to make that vision a reality. Examples of questioning techniques are the miracle question, scaling questions and coping questions.</p><p id="__p3478">The SFT treatment ingredients were incorporated in a new intervention, consisting of one individual meeting, and four group meetings. In every group meeting one topic is discussed in a SF manner. Topics were: Law and Legislation, Social Support, Medical &#x00026; Cognitive Problems, and Strength &#x00026; Weaknesses. To evaluate the effect of the intervention on RTW, a cohort study is performed.</p><p id="__p3479">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lonneke Opsteegh, MSc, Center for Rehabilitation, UMCG, Groningen, 9700 RB; l.opsteegh@cvr.umcg.nl</p><p id="__p3480">PST-195</p><p id="__p3481">ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE AND WORKPLACE BULLYING AMONG CIVIL SERVANTS IN JAPAN</p><p id="__p3482">Kanami Tsuno, MPH, Akiomi Inoue, MS and Norito Kawakami, MD, PhD</p><p id="__p3483">Department of Mental Health, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.</p><p id="__p3484">Background: The association between organizational justice and workplace bullying has not yet been investigated, while the workplace atmosphere is supposed to responsible for it. The objective of the study was to explore the cross-sectional association of organizational justice, as well as job strain (the ratio of job demands to job control) and effort-reward imbalance, with workplace bullying in a sample of civil servants in Japan.</p><p id="__p3485">Methods: The study sample consisted of 807 males and 735 females of the civil servants in the Kanto region in Japan (response rate, 46.7%). They were asked to fill in a self-administered questionnaire including scales of workplace bullying, organizational justice (interactional justice and procedure justice), job demands and job control, effort-reward imbalance (ERI), supervisor and coworker support, and other covariates (sex, age, marital status, occupational status, employment contract, work shift, overtime in the past month, unit size, and sex ratio of the unit). Workplace bullying was measured by the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised, and was defined as those experiencing at least one of 22 negative acts weekly or more frequently during the past six months. Each job stressor variable was categorized into the tertiles. Odds ratio of workplace bullying associated with each job stressor was estimated by using logistic regression analysis, using the lowest tertile as the reference, adjusting for the covariates.</p><p id="__p3486">Results: After adjustment for the covariates, high interactional justice (odds ratio 0.23, 95%Cl 0.14-0.39) and high procedure justice (odds ratio 0.21, 95%Cl 0.13-0.34) were negatively associated with workplace bullying.

Associations of income level (lower or higher than &#x000a5;5,000,000 of annual household income), educational attainment (lower or higher than the level of high school education) and occupational class (managerial or not) with depression were examined. Based on a recent validation test among Japanese workers using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, depression was defined as a dichotomize variable with a cut point of the CES-D scores 19 or above. Occupational stress was evaluated using Japanese versions of demand-control questionnaire and effort-reward questionnaire. Using the sex-specific median values, we produced a quadrant scheme with 4 exposure categories, with low job demand and high job control representing a relax job, high job demand and high job control representing an active job, low job demand and low job control representing a passive job, and high job demand and low job control representing a strain job. According to Siegrist, we defined a ratio of the scales &#x02018;effort&#x02019; and &#x02018;rewards&#x02019;, weighted for number of items where a value&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1 as the critical &#x02018;high cost / low gain&#x02019; condition.</p><p id="__p3495">Univariate analyses showed that depression was prevalent among the lower socioeconomic groups than the counterpart groups. Strain and passive jobs were prevalent among lower socioeconomic groups, whereas effort-reward imbalance tended to be prevalent among higher socioeconomic groups. Multivariate analyses revealed that socioeconomic indices were not associated with depression but the occupational stressors were significantly associated with depression. The association between occupational class and depression appeared to be explained by occupational stress, in particular, low job control.</p><p id="__p3496">In conclusion, the current cross-sectional analyses in our Japanese sample did not reveal independent associations between socioeconomic state of interests and depression. Although the two occupational stressors were associated with socioeconomic indices differently, they were consistently associated with depression.</p><p id="__p3497">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Akizumi Tsutsumi, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, 807-8555; tsutsumi@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583829882592" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figac_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figac_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figac_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583829882592" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p3498">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Gyongyver Salavecz, MsC, Semmelweis University, Institute of Behavioral Sciences, Budapest, H-1084; salavecz@gmail.com</p><p id="__p3499">PST-198</p><p id="__p3500">GROUP COHESION AND ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT: PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR NURSE RESIDENTS?</p><p id="__p3501">Angela Li, BA,<sup>1</sup> Sean F.

This often makes it difficult for hospitals to recruit nurses and to retain experienced staff. Current research has found that new nurses may be particularly vulnerable to job stress, and that stress levels among nurses are inversely related to job satisfaction. Purpose: To determine if nurse resident&#x02019;s (NRs) sense of group cohesion and organizational commitment serve as protective factors against the negative effects of pre-existing trauma and current stress on job satisfaction, burnout, and fatigue. Methods: A longitudinal study of 178 nurse residents (15 male, 163 female) from Childrens Hospital Los Angeles was conducted across three time points. Levels of pre-existing trauma, current stress, compassion satisfaction, burnout, compassion fatigue, job satisfaction, group cohesion and organizational commitment were measured. A range of regression models was developed to examine the relationships between the predictor variables (pre-existing stress and current stress), the moderating variables (group cohesion and organizational commitment), and outcome variables of interest (job satisfaction, fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction). Results: Higher organizational commitment scores provided a &#x02018;protective&#x02019; effect against pre-existing trauma with respect to compassion satisfaction (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.35, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001). Group cohesion was found to be a predictor of job satisfaction, and was found to have protective effects for job satisfaction from pre-existing trauma and current stress (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.25, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001); it also provided direct &#x02018;protection&#x02019; against burnout, which was affected by current stress (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.24, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Pre-existing trauma was a strong predictor of fatigue, and accounted for 50% of observed variance in fatigue scores with (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.50, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Conclusion: Results from the study suggest that group cohesion and organizational commitment serve as protective factors against the negative effects of pre-existing trauma and current stress. The findings have implications for hospital-based interventions structured to address nurse stress, while enhancing group cohesion and organizational commitment.</p><p id="__p3504">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jeffrey I.

The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate whether processes that prolong the mental exposure to work stressors, e.g. overcommitment (OC), along with psychosocial work conditions, predicts fatigue and poor next-day recovery six months later. 160 women working in dental care completed self-ratings in questionnaires at two time points, six months apart. Psychosocial work conditions and OC were used to predict fatigue and poor next-day recovery respectively, in multiple regression analyses. Results show that having children living at home, high job demands and high OC were associated with fatigue six months later. Job demands and OC, but not having children at home, predicted poor next-day recovery. Sobel&#x02019;s test and bootstrapping procedure indicated that OC partly mediated the relationship between job demands and fatigue and between job demands and next-day recovery.

Structured interviews were conducted among 109 NHW and 131 NHB nursing staff between September 2006 and July 2007. Demographic and occupational information was self-reported. We used questions from the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) to assess three aspects of the psychosocial work environment: job demands, job control and social support at work. We dichotomized each JCQ measure at the median to create high and low groups. Job strain was defined as the combination of reporting high demands and low control. We first examined racial differences in JCQ measures among all nursing staff. Next we contrasted RN/LPN (38.2%) vs. CNA (61.2%). Potential confounders included age, gender, marital status, education, income, occupation, facility and duration at current job.</p><p id="__p3550">Results: NHB nursing staff were more likely to report high strain jobs compared to NHW (49.1% vs. 7.9%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, NHB nursing staff were more likely to report high strain, compared to NHW peers (Odds Ratio [OR]: 6.1, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.4-15.1, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Stratified analysis showed that NHB CNA were more likely to report job strain than NHW CNA (OR: 12.0, 95% CI: 3.1-46.1, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). RN/LPN reported less job strain overall (7 out of 85 nurses), limiting the power to detect potential disparities. There were no differences regarding social support at work in either occupation.</p><p id="__p3551">Conclusion: NHB nurses, compared to NHW nurses, were six times more likely to report job strain. The effect was higher among CNA. There are several possible reasons for these differences, including confounding by an unmeasured variable such as skill level or differential self-report by race. These differences may also reflect unmeasured organizational and interpersonal behaviors, including discrimination based on race. Further research should consider these alternative explanations for racial disparities in self-reported job strain.</p><p id="__p3552">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: David Hurtado, MSc, Harvard School of Public Health, Cambridge, MA, 02139; hurtado.d@gmail.com</p><p id="__p3553">PST-204b</p><p id="__p3554">A PROJECT FOR PREVENTING SUICIDES : SCREENING FOR DEPRESSION (2)</p><p id="__p3555">Reiko Hori, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Hikari Furui, PhD<sup>2</sup> and Fumio Kobayashi, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3556"><sup>1</sup>Health &#x00026; Psychosocial Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan and <sup>2</sup>Psychology, Aichi Shukutoku University, Aichi, Japan.</p><p id="__p3557">Background and purpose: We have launched the project of screening for depression among workers in local area from 2007. The results of the first year are shown in the other paper, which shows that job involved factors may relate to a depressive mood of workers. The purpose of this year survey is to verify the previous results and examine if job involved factors increase depressive mood. Methods and Results: We performed screening of depression for 428 male and 249 female workers, who work in some small enterprises, during their annual medical checkup in 2008. They answered self-reported questionnaire including items screening for depression, living alone or not, work arrangement, working time, job demand, physical loads, job control, friendly work place or not, and job satisfaction. Following the first screening, 92 men and 63 women were determined as highly depressive. Among them, 87 men and 63 women were interviewed using CIDI-SS-RR as a second screening. Finally, 20 men and 12 women were detected as ones to be recommended for medical care. Highly depressive men by the first screening were more likely to live alone (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), and had more job demand (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), more physical loads (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), less friendly work place (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), less job satisfaction (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) than non-highly depressive men. Highly depressive women by the first screening had more job demand (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), less job control (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), and less job satisfaction (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) more than non-highly depressive women. Men that were recommended for medical care were more likely to live alone (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and had more physical loads (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), less job satisfaction (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), and less friendly work place (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) than non-highly depressive men by the first screening. Women that were recommended medical care had more job demand (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) than non-highly depressive women by the first screening. Depressiveness of 18 men and 14 women increased in 2008. There was the trend to increase in physical loads and decrease in work place friendship or job satisfaction among these men, and that to increase in physical loads and decrease in job control or job satisfaction among these women.

M-R provides self-check questionnaires on stress symptoms and work and lifestyle related stressors, and a computer-tailored personal report based on the check results via internet. This study tested the effect of individually computer-tailored messages designed to maintain mental wellness and reduce work and lifestyle related stressors.</p><p id="__p3564">METHODS: Employees of a Japanese IT company were surveyed using M-R at baseline, and 317 males, who were not under treatment for mental illness and having few depressive symptoms (CES-D&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;16), were randomly assigned to Group C in which the participants receive a simple report containing scores and charts only or Group M in which participants receive individually tailored stress-management messages added to the simple report. The change in stress symptoms and work and lifestyle related stressors were examined on 206 participants who answered both 2- and 4-month follow-up surveys using M-R. At 2-month survey, those participants exhibited higher depressive symptoms (CES-D&#x02009;&#x02267;&#x02009;16) received an additional message from a medical doctor.</p><p id="__p3565">RESULTS: At 2&#x000a0;months, maintenance of mental wellness and improvement of lifestyle were observed in 7% more participants in the Group M, but the difference was not statistically significant. Of those who scored over 16 on CES-D at 2&#x000a0;months and received a doctor&#x02019;s message, the CES-D score significantly decreased at 4&#x000a0;months in Group M only (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Somatic stress symptoms also tended to decrease at 2&#x000a0;months in Group M and it maintained up to 4&#x000a0;months.

Psychological demands (PD: calculated with 5 items), decision latitude (DL: 6 items), and social support (SS: 6 items) were assessed with the J-DCSQ. One-week test-retest reliability and internal consistency were estimated by means of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, respectively. Concurrent validity was evaluated with Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient for which the Japanese-version JCQ (J-JCQ) was used as the reference.

This study examined the effect of working hours on fatigue and depressive symptoms among particular industries and occupations. Longitudinal data on 1,588 Japanese daytime workers (575 women and 1,013 men) were used to estimate the effect of working hours on fatigue and depressive symptoms. Working hours per week at baseline was divided into three categories: &#x0201c;less than 60&#x000a0;h&#x0201d; (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,346, 84.8%), &#x0201c;61-65&#x000a0;h&#x0201d; (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;87, 5.5%), and &#x0201c;66&#x000a0;h or more&#x0201d; (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;155, 9.8%). Participants completed the Self-Diagnosis Check List for Assessment of Worker&#x02019;s Accumulated Fatigue developed by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at 1-year follow-up. Industries were divided into 13 categories based on the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Rev. 4 by the United Nations. Occupations were divided into 6 categories based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations-88 by the International Labour Office. Analyses of variance were carried out separately for industries and occupations. Multiple comparisons with Bonferroni method indicated that in the manufacturing industry and professionals, the &#x0201c;66&#x000a0;h or more&#x0201d; group had a higher level of fatigue than the &#x0201c;less than 60&#x000a0;h&#x0201d; group (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

Although reducing the number of working hours is essential to ameliorate workers&#x02019; fatigue, special attention should be paid to workers in manufacturing or human health and social work activities industries and professionals who work long hours. Especially, workers employed in the human health and social work activities industry who worked at least 61 hours per week, showed higher scores of fatigue. This suggests that the association between working hours and fatigue is varied among different industrial sectors.</p><p id="__p3614">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Yasumasa Otsuka, PhD, Graduate School of Education, Hiroshima University, Higashi-hiroshima, 739-8524; yasumasa-otsuka@hiroshima-u.ac.jp</p><p id="__p3615">PST-204j</p><p id="__p3616">ARE GENERAL MENTAL ABILITY AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WORK CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO MID-LIFE HEALTH IN WORKING WOMEN AND MEN?</p><p id="__p3617">Cornelia Wulff, PhD student,<sup>1</sup> Petra Lindfors, Ass professor<sup>1</sup> and Magnus Sverke, professor<sup>1,2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3618"><sup>1</sup>Stockholm University, Psychology, Stockholm, Sweden and <sup>2</sup>WorkWell: Research Unit for People, Policy and Performance, North-West University, North-West, South Africa.</p><p id="__p3619">Psychosocial work conditions including high demands, lack of control and support have been linked to poor health.

The present study set out to investigate how childhood mental ability and psychosocial work characteristics relate to different health indicators in a cohort of working women(n&#x02009;=&#x02009;271) and men (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;291). Specifically, childhood GMA and self-reports of job demands, job control and social support were linked to two positive health indicators (sense of coherence and self-rated health) and two negative health indicators(musculoskeletal problems and anxiety in midlife). Considering the gendered labor market and variations in health patterns between women and men, gender specific analyses were performed. Results revealed no linkages between childhood GMA and the health indicators included. Further, there were no significant interactions between GMA and the psychosocial factors. The overall impact of occupational level was low and controlling for occupational level did not change the results much. These findings are likely to result from the study cohort being fairly homogeneous and the women and men being in good health.</p><p id="__p3620">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Cornelia Wulff, PhD student, Psychology, Stockholm University, Stockolm, 10691; cwf@psychology.su.se</p><p id="__p3621">PST-204k</p><p id="__p3622">EARLY SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN EMPLOYEES AND THEIR SUPPORT NEEDS</p><p id="__p3623">Mayo Suzuki, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Suguru Okubo, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Iori Tani, PhD,<sup>3</sup> Wakaha Ikeda, PhD,<sup>4</sup> Kazuhito Yokoyama, PhD<sup>4</sup> and Fumihiko Kitamura, PhD<sup>4</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3624"><sup>1</sup>Bunri University of Hospitality, Sayama-shi, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu-shi, Japan and <sup>4</sup>untendo University Faculty of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Japan.</p><p id="__p3625">Background: Mental health problems of employees have become a vital issue. More and more employees have taken sick leave due to mental health problems and have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorders and so on. Many employers have implemented mental health care programs or employed mental healthcare professionals. Early detection of and early intervention in mental health problems are expected to alleviate employees&#x02019; mental health problems and improve the productivity of companies.</p><p id="__p3626">Purpose: The purpose of this study is to show the early symptoms of mental health problems in employees and the support needs perceived by employees with mental health problems, and to consider preventive measures in regard to the mental health of employees.</p><p id="__p3627">Method: We conducted research of industrial physicians and medical staff into typical patterns of the initial symptoms of mental health disorders in the workplace.

This study was aimed to explore the relationship between work stress and the quality of work lives, especially under the circumstances of given work stress, the moderating effects of labor activities on the work stress and quality of work lives.</p><p id="__p3635">Methods: Developed, structured and validated questionnaire was released by mails to hospital physician executives in the period of Aug-Nov 2009 and 737 respondents returned in this study with a response rate of 32.83%. Measures included work stressors as financial-oriented and norm-oriented, and work lives as work and career satisfaction, health status and illness, and substance uses. Labor activities were measured as body labors and leisure activities. Personal characteristics and work status of hospital physician executives were also collected. Descriptive analyses, factor analyses, and multiple regressions were performed.</p><p id="__p3636">Results: Controlling the personal characteristics and work status of hospital physician executives, it was found that perceived financial-oriented and norm-oriented stresses by hospital physician executives had lower work satisfaction and career satisfaction, more illness symptoms, and worse perceived health status; however, more labor activities had positive effects on quality of work lives. Especially, body labors could moderate financial-oriented stress to better career and work satisfaction, better perceived health status, less muscular illness, and reduced sleeping disorders.

Among other end-points hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke have been possible to predict in research using reactivity measures. However, these predictions have not always been successful. Progress needs to be made. One of the possibilities is using cardiovascular recovery in addition to reactivity in the prediction of pathological processes of hemodynamics and neuroendocrinology as well as direct disorders and diseases. New steps towards applying the research results in clinical practice are necessary to realize the promises of cardiovascular behavioral research. This symposium is one step in this direction.</p><p id="__p3648">In this symposium researchers will present papers regarding different aspects of cardiovascular regulation, reactivity, and recovery. The symposium starts with Dr Gellman who has comprehensively studied the relationship among hostility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiac structure &#x00026; function. Dr. Gellman&#x02019;s research is relevant for many of the most common life style factors. The second paper will be Dr. Hamer&#x02019;s presentation regarding psychophysiological responses and their relationship with sub-clinical coronary heart disease. This topic will help particularly in the planning of coronary heart disease prevention. Third, Dr. Tuomisto will illuminate different patterns of cardiovascular reactivity and recovery in intra-arterial blood pressure of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. The results may promote research in the prediction of cardiovascular risks. The last presentation will be Dr. Zanstra&#x02019;s study of challenge appraisals&#x02019; role in the prediction of a myocardial reaction pattern in anticipation of and reactivity to a naturalistic stressor. The study has interest especially for those who do research in real world circumstances. All these presentations will have both indirect and direct relevance for clinical research in the prediction and prevention of cardiovascular diseases in addition to more basic theoretical issues.</p><p id="__p3649">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Martti T.

The present study examined associations between cynical hostility (CynHo), MetS factors, and cardiac structure and function in 186 (81.7% Hispanic) post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients (69.4% men) with a mean age of 53.3 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.8) years. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test a model of MetS. Primary MetS variables included waist circumference (WC), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glucose area under the curve (G-AUC), triglycerides (TRIG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and diastolic blood pressures (DBP). Secondary MetS variables included plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and a latent inflammation variable comprised of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Cardiac function variables were fractional shortening (FS), a measure of cardiac contractility, E/A ratio, a measure of cardiac compliance, and rate-pressure product (RPP), a measure of myocardial oxygen demand. Cardiac structure variables were left ventricular mass index, left ventricular posterior wall thickness at diastole, and interventricular septal thickness at diastole, which together constituted the latent variable cardiac mass (CM). The final structural model had good model fit (&#x003c7;2 (102) = 100.65, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.52, CFI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.00, RMSEA&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00, and SRMR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). Direct paths were supported between WC and CM and all MetS factors except TRIG and G-AUC. WC was indirectly associated with DBP via CM. WC demonstrated indirect relationships with the cardiac function measures. The model supported positive direct paths between HOMA-IR and G-AUC, TRIG, and PAI-1, but not inflammation or HDL-C. With respect to cardiac function, HOMA-IR demonstrated a direct positive association with RPP and direct inverse associations with FS and E/A ratio. CynHo had a direct positive relationship with HOMA-IR but none with WC. The relationships observed suggest that central adiposity and IR play a primary role in cardiac structural and functional impairment. The findings suggest that CynHo could promote the progression of metabolic dysfunction and cardiac disease via factors that influence the efficiency of glucose metabolism.</p><p id="__p3655">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Martti T.

The present study was designed to examine associations of disturbed psychophysiological responses with sub-clinical atherosclerosis. Participants were 543 healthy men and women (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;62.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.7&#x000a0;yrs), without history or objective signs of CVD, drawn from the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort. Various cardiovascular (beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate variability) and biological measures (inflammatory and haemostatic markers, salivary cortisol) were assessed during and following mental stressors, consisting of a 5-min Stroop task and a 5-min mirror tracing task. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), a measure of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, was measured using electron beam computed tomography. The tasks induced significant increases in blood pressure, cortisol, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen. Cortisol responders were at higher risk of having clinically relevant levels of CAC (odds ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.17, 95% CI, 1.37 - 3.41) after adjustments for age, gender, baseline cortisol, social status, depressive symptoms, and conventional risk factors. Cardiovascular responses were not associated with CAC. Basal levels of inflammatory markers were associated with CAC although the stress responses were not. These data support the notion that cortisol stress reactivity, an index of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal function, is one of the possible mechanisms through which psychosocial stress may influence the risk of CHD.</p><p id="__p3661">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Martti T.

Later, recovery from such stress has been studied for similar reasons. Our purpose was to study cardiovascular reactivity from a baseline condition, a relaxation to behavioral stress tasks and recovery from the tasks to a relaxation condition after the tasks. As data, we used the Tampere Ambulatory Hypertension Study data bank of intra-arterial blood pressure (BP) from the 1990&#x02019;s. The participants were 95 newly detected, WHO-classified, age-matched normotensive (NT; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;33), borderline hypertensive (BHT; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) and hypertensive (HT; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;32) men recruited through routine health examinations. They underwent a 5-minute cue-controlled relaxation (R1) followed by 8 standardized behavioral challenges: a video game, arithmetic, social problem solving, imagery, a habituation test, a comic film, and the cold pressor test. After the tasks, a 10-minute relaxation period (R2) was started. Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) and heart rate (HR) and were analyzed. First, in a mixed-design ANOVA, Time factor, R1 (the reactivity baseline) and R2 (the recovery baseline) was studied together with the groups. The Time x Group interactions did not differ for SBP, DBP and HR: Fs(2, 92) &#x0003c; 1.04. However, the direction of recovery was different for BPs and HR. During the recovery baseline, HR was lower than during the reactivity baseline. The reverse was true for both SBP and DBP. Second, R2 variables were compared in ANCOVA using R1 variables as covariates. Following main effects were obtained: SBP, F(2, 91) = 3.14, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05 and DBP, F(2, 91) = 5.98, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.005. In Bonferroni controlled group contrasts, the recovery baseline measures showed differences between the hypertensive groups in DBP (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05, 95% confidence interval&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8 - 6.59) while reactivity measures had shown DBP differences between these groups only in the cold pressor test. In conclusion, intra-arterial BP and HR in NT and newly detected HT groups showed different patterns in reactivity respective recovery. These results are in accordance of some earlier research and show that optimizing the use of cardiovascular data requires that these different patterns are taken into account in the predictions of health risks.</p><p id="__p3667">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Martti T.

Further, it was examined how these vascular and myocardial parameters relate to cognitive appraisal in a real-life stressful situation. 24 men aged 19-28 (mean age: 23.5; SD: 2.5) participated in this study. Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded on a beat-to-beat basis before and during performance of a real life speech. Vascular and myocardial hemodynamic parameters (total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cardiac output (CO), respectively) were derived from the blood pressure waveform. Participants&#x02019; appraisals were obtained prior to the stressor. Evidence was obtained suggesting a myocardial reaction pattern during the stressor. This finding is consistent with the hypotheses as the stressor is an active coping task. The anticipation was hypothesized to be a relatively passive situation and therefore expected to engender a vascular response. However, the reaction pattern during anticipation was myocardial. Finally, recovery was slower in the vascular than in the myocardial variables. Multilevel regression models (MLwiN v2.2) were used to analyze the relationships between appraisal and CO and TPR. During the anticipation period prior to the stressor, increased challenge was associated with decreased vascular resistance (Z&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.70 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01) and increased myocardial reactivity (Z&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.43 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). During the stressor increases in challenge were associated with further increases in myocardial responding (Z&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.03 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) but relationships between appraisal and vascular resistance were not significant (Z&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.82, n.s.). This study is among the first to examine the hemodynamic reactivity and recovery patterns to a real life stressor in conjunction with stressor appraisals. Furthermore, our findings suggest that challenge appraisals to real-life stressors contribute to an, arguably healthier, myocardial reaction pattern. This ambulatory study was followed up by a study aimed at changing appraisals and appraisal related hemodynamic reactivity patterns.</p><p id="__p3673">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Martti T.

Optimal use of these technologies requires that we advance our understanding of how individuals respond to health imagery, particularly since information processes for imagery differ markedly from those involved with linguistic information. This symposium reviews recent research on techniques using visual images to motivate behavior change. The speakers represent multidisciplinary teams of experts in psychology, sociology, communications, graphics, and information technology. Gerry Humphris will present research on using graphic warning labels on cigarette packets to motivate smoking cessation. Using data from a large community survey, his team found that images evoking disgust responses are potent triggers of motivations to quit. Gareth Hollands will present research on an intervention in which aversive images are used to condition responses that reduce motivations to eat unhealthy foods. This technique, based on implicit cognition and evaluative conditioning principles, altered implicit attitudes about foods and increased healthy food choices. Susan Persky will present research in which immersive virtual environment (IVE) technologies are used to motivate protective behavior. The studies demonstrate how IVEs can instill experiential knowledge of behavioral consequences and enhance understanding of complex concepts such as gene-behavior interactions. Brian Williams will present research on a framework for developing theoretically-guided interventions involving visual media. The four-stage process was tested in the development of an intervention incorporating 3D animation about links between obesity and arteriosclerosis. Throughout the symposium, discussion will address how the research informs theory on visual imagery processes in health behavior as well as the use of imagery in interventions.</p><p id="__p3679">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Linda D.

Furthermore, IVEs are typically interactive, opening the door to more detailed understanding and personalization of visual information.</p><p id="__p3697">These features could heighten many types of health messages conveyed via visual imagery. For example, a major purpose for invoking imagery is to demonstrate consequences of one&#x02019;s behavior (e.g., illustrating detrimental effects of smoking). These consequences can be experienced firsthand in an IVE, and an interactive component could include practicing and building efficacy for cessation behaviors while observing how these behaviors mitigate health consequences. Indeed, an imagery-based IVE for smoking cessation was recently created by Canadian researchers.</p><p id="__p3698">Another use of imagery involves conveying health concepts, often via metaphor (e.g., a ladder as a metaphor for varying risk levels). In IVEs individuals can directly experience a visual metaphor. They might also manipulate situational variables to gain nuanced understanding of the processes a metaphor conveys. Our group created and tested immersive visual metaphors based on an elevator and a bridge for conveying genetics concepts. Going forward, IVEs are poised to become an innovative medium for imagery provision and a vital research tool for exploring issues around image effectiveness.</p><p id="__p3699">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Susan Persky, PhD, Social and Behavioral Research Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD, 20015; perskys@mail.nih.gov</p><p id="__p3700">SS30d</p><p id="__p3701">DOES DISGUSTING IMAGERY AID HEALTH PROMOTION CAMPAIGNS?</p><p id="__p3702">Gerry Humphris, PhD<sup>1</sup> and Brian Williams, PhD<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3703"><sup>1</sup>Health Psychology, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom and <sup>2</sup>Public Health, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p3704">Recent research has highlighted the possibility that the emotion of disgust can act as a significant driver to initiate behaviour change as a separate or even additional component to traditional fear appeal approaches. Pictorial images may be particularly effective in generating disgust emotion. Therefore the aim of this investigation was to test the specific image qualities associated with reported disgust and rating of potential success in promoting behaviour change. Data were obtained from a public consultation exercise (Department of Health, England and Wales, 2006) that requested, through a web-based answering system, participant preferences of 42 images that might be effective to encourage tobacco cessation in smokers. Initial results indicated preferences for effectiveness of cessation message were rank ordered according to the level of disgust emotion generated, i.e. images that might persuade smokers to quit tobacco consumption appeared revolting. To confirm that disgust emotion generated by the UK tobacco packet images was associated to the public&#x02019;s selection of possible effective images; three cross-sectional opinion surveys were conducted. These included students from medicine and psychology disciplines, and a section of the public. The web opinion consultation database was utilised for secondary analysis. A total of 291 participants were involved in the three convenience surveys and 19812 participants gave complete replies to the public consultation website. The pictorial Disgust Sensitivity Scale was used to assess the individual&#x02019;s rating of every image on a five category rating ranging from &#x02018;extremely disgusting&#x02019; to &#x02018;not disgusting&#x02019;. Significant correlations (ranging from 0.91 to 0.94) existed between the image rank order aggregated preference ratings from the original public consultation and the average final score of the disgust ratings for specific items for the three groups. The correlations were very similar regardless of smoking status of respondents (in both public preference and opinion surveys). The emotion of disgust may be a possible intervening variable to explain the initial reactions to health promotion materials and smoking cessation. Future research needs to explore the strength of disgust emotions and fear generated by images of this nature with actual behaviour change and other intervening constructs.</p><p id="__p3705">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Gerry Humphris, PhD, Health Psychology, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, KY16 9TS; gmh4@st-and.ac.uk</p><p id="__p3706">SS13</p><p id="__p3707">THE ROLE OF SALIVA CORTISOL MEASUREMENTS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE - A MATTER OF THEORY AND METHODOLOGY</p><p id="__p3708">Margareta Kristenson, MD PhD,<sup>1</sup> Petra Lindfors, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Ulf Lundberg, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Anette Harris, PhD,<sup>3</sup> &#x000c5;se M.

The diagnosis of cancer represents a threat to survival; consequently, both patients and physicians believe that transient sleep dysfunction in response is normal. Currently, relatively little is known about the etiology and evolution of insomnia in cancer patients. Emerging evidence suggests that a significant minority of cancer patients develop a chronic persistent form of insomnia as a result of the diagnosis and treatment of their cancer. Chronic insomnia is a substantial problem; in the general population insomnia is a risk factor for additional morbidity (e.g., depression, fatigue, heart disease). This symposium will first discuss the prevalence of insomnia and its progression over an 18-month period in a large sample of newly diagnosed cancer patients. The second presentation will describe the sleep architecture of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Polysomnographic sleep findings revealing the prevalence of slow wave sleep (SWS) in cancer patients before treatment, following treatment, and at later follow-up will be discussed. Finally, results from a national randomized clinical trial of YOCAS &#x000ae; Yoga will show how a brief, community-based intervention of 4&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; duration can significantly reduce insomnia and use of sleep medication in cancer survivors, suggesting that persistent insomnia responds quickly to a behavioral exercise intervention and can be treated easily and effectively. The goal of this symposium is to disseminate exciting recent findings in the areas of sleep and cancer and to generate new ideas and an awareness of chronic insomnia in cancer patients so that its negative effects can be addressed.</p><p id="__p3767">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Oxana Palesh, PhD, MPH, Radiation Oncology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14642; oxana_palesh@urmc.rochester.edu</p><p id="__p3768">SS14a</p><p id="__p3769">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF INSOMNIA COMORBID WITH CANCER: RESULTS OF AN 18-MONTH LONGIDUTINAL STUDY</p><p id="__p3770">Jos&#x000e9;e Savard, PhD,<sup>1,2</sup> Julie Villa, MPs,<sup>1</sup> Aude Caplette-Gingras, BA,<sup>1,2</sup> Hans Ivers, PhD<sup>1,2</sup> and Charles M.

All patients scheduled to undergo surgery after a first diagnosis of non-metastatic cancer were solicited at their pre-operative visit. Among the 3196 patients approached, 1681 were found eligible and 962 (57%) accepted to participate. The participants completed a semi-structured interview for insomnia at baseline (T1), 2 (T2), 6 (T3), 10 (T4), 14 (T5) and 18&#x000a0;months (T6). The prevalence of the insomnia syndrome (T1: 28%; T2: 26%; T3: 25%; T4: 23%; T5: 21%; T6: 22%) decreased progressively and significantly over the 18-month period, F(5,3725) = 7.58, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01. Similarly, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms (including patients with an insomnia syndrome) decreased steadily and significantly over time (T1: 60%; T2: 48%; 46%; T3: 46%; T4: 41%; T5: 38%; T6: 37%), F(53725) =43.77, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01. Simple effects indicated that the decrease was significant between T1 and T2 and between T3 and T4 (ps&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Prevalence rates of insomnia symptoms were the highest in breast cancer patients (42-69%) and the lowest in prostate cancer patients (25-38%). The overall reduction in prevalence rates was reproduced for each cancer site except for prostate cancer patients in which the decline between T1 and T4, was followed by a resurgence of insomnia symptoms. Based on mixed models analyses, the incidence of insomnia among good sleepers at the previous time assessment was 20% at T2, 22% at T3, 17% at T4, 17% at T5, and 14% at T6. Insomnia is highly prevalent in cancer patients, particularly at the time of cancer surgery and then decreases progressively over time. Despite this overall pattern, insomnia symptoms develop in a significant proportion of patients during the cancer care trajectory, thus suggesting distinct patterns of evolution across patients.</p><p id="__p3773">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jos&#x000e9;e Savard, PhD, Laval University Cancer Research Center, Universit&#x000e9; Laval, Qu&#x000e9;bec, QC, G1R 2&#x000a0;J6; josee.savard@psy.ulaval.ca</p><p id="__p3774">SS14b</p><p id="__p3775">SLEEP ARCHITECTURE AND SLOW-WAVE SLEEP PREVALENCE FROM 102 POLYSOMNOGRAPHY ASSESSMENTS IN PATIENTS PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING CHEMOTHERAPY</p><p id="__p3776">Joseph A.

Most subjects (20) were female breast cancer patients. Five patients (3 males) had colorectal cancer and one (female) had lymphoma. The mean age of the 23 women was 52.4 and for the three men was 56.7.

We conducted a nationwide, multi-site, phase II/III randomized, controlled, clinical trial examining the efficacy of yoga for improving insomnia. Non-metastatic, cancer survivors suffering from moderate or greater sleep disruption between 2-24&#x000a0;months after completing adjuvant therapy with no participation in yoga during the previous 3&#x000a0;months were randomized into 2 arms: 1) standard care monitoring and 2) standard care plus the 4-week (wk) yoga intervention (2 x&#x02019;s/wk; 75&#x000a0;min./session). The yoga intervention utilized the Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS&#x000ae;) program consisting of pranayama (breathing exercises), 18 gentle Hatha and Restorative yoga asanas (postures) and meditation. Insomnia was assessed pre- and post-intervention using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). 410 survivors were accrued (96% female, mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;54, 75% breast cancer). ANCOVAs with baseline covariates revealed significant differences in insomnia (ISI total score; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) between groups at post-intervention with the yoga group exhibiting greater reductions in insomnia (CS&#x02009;=&#x02009;change score; CS&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;3.49, standard error&#x02009;=&#x02009;SE; SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.37) compared to the control group (CS&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.89, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.29). ANCOVAs also demonstrated significant differences between groups in difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up too early, sleep satisfaction, sleep interference, sleep-related distress and sleep problems noticeable to others (all p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) at post-intervention with the yoga group improving the most. ANCOVAs also revealed significant differences in sleep medication use (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) with the yoga group reducing medication (CS&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.21, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09) while the control group increased medication (CS&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07). The brief community-based YOCAS&#x000ae; yoga intervention significantly improves insomnia and sleep components while reducing sleep medication use among survivors.

The relationship between adolescent mental health and medicine use (MU) has not received sufficient attention. The present analyses examine relationships of adolescent mental health and MU and whether mental health contributes to MU beyond the effect of experiencing symptoms of those health problems. Self-reported mental health, MU for four common health problems (headache, stomachache, difficulties sleeping, and nervousness) and symptoms for common health problems were assessed in a nationally-representative sample of 7,611 U.S. students in grades 6 through 10 and in 26,111 11-, 13-, and 15-year-old students in six countries participating in the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children study: Austria, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Macedonia, and Scotland. A brief measure of depression was included in the US HBSC survey and a broader mental health index (KIDSCREEN) was included in the surveys of the six European nations. In US adolescents, depression predicted MU for each of the four health problems but when both depression and symptoms were in the regression models depression added to the prediction for difficulties sleeping (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.0071) and nervousness (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001) only. These findings were replicated in the European sample; using hierarchical linear modeling, there no significant effects due to country. MU for each of the four health problems was predicted by mental health; however, MU for headache and stomachache were no longer significant when symptoms were added to the models. Adolescents with poorer mental/psychological health are more likely to experience symptoms of common health problems and to take medicine for these problems. However, self-reported symptoms may partially mediate the relationship between adolescent mental health and MU.</p><p id="__p3809">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Bj&#x000f8;rn E.

The outcome measure was self-reported medicine use for headache within the last month. We included two measures of socioeconomic position; family affluence measured by the Family Affluence Scale (FAS) and family occupational class. Analyses stratified by country were controlled for gender, age and the prevalence of headache.</p><p id="__p3816">Results: The distribution of children categorised in high, medium and low FAS varied between countries. High FAS varied between 12.7% in Romania and 55.9% in Sweden. Children categorised in high family occupational class varied as well, from 5.8% in Austria to 49.2% in United Kingdom. Family affluence showed no association with medicine use for headache in any of the countries. In analyses combined for all countries, OR for medium FAS&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98 (CI: 0.95-1.02), OR for low FAS&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.99 (CI: 0.94-1.03). Family occupational class showed significant associations with medicine use for headache in ten out of 17 countries, e.g. OR for low family occupational class in Denmark&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.42 (CI: 1.22-1.67).</p><p id="__p3817">Conclusions: It seems that different aspects of SEP influence medicine use among adolescents differently.

These parts will then be combined in the context of the study of ADHD medication use in adolescents.</p><p id="__p3824">The very word &#x02018;adolescence&#x02019; draws attention to the developmental perspective of any study involving adolescents. Advances in developmental neuroscience can help decide on age boundaries. However, the developmental perspective requires more than age boundaries due to the social and cultural aspects and expectations in this transitional phase, particularly in multi-national adolescents&#x02019; medicine use studies. Consequences of this developmental perspective for data collection and data analysis will be discussed.</p><p id="__p3825">With regard to medication use, prescription medication and over-the-counter medication are often distinguished. Another distinction is on-label, off-label and unlicensed medication. A special issue in adolescence is the study of compliance since adolescents seem more reluctant to take medicine according to instructions. Over-the-counter drugs and the use of illegal drugs also require specific attention when we study adolescents&#x02019; medicine use, as does the difference between incidental and frequent or prolonged medicine use. These differences have consequences for data collection and data analysis.</p><p id="__p3826">Adolescents&#x02019; use of ADHD medication is usually on-prescription. Methodological issues in the study of prolonged monitoring of adolescents&#x02019; ADHD medication use as hindered by factors belonging to the developmental perspective and as supported by technological opportunities, will be discussed. Finally, some issues and opportunities in the study of non-prescribed ADHD medication will be presented.</p><p id="__p3827">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Bj&#x000f8;rn E.

Individuals may initiate BB because of either extreme dieting or chronic negative affect. In order to gain a better comprehension of BB and the main risk factors (thin ideal, body dissatisfaction, restrained dieting, and negative affect) two structural models were built and compared by sex (the DPM of women vs. the DPM of men) in order to detect which one of the group&#x02019;s models: a) shows more risk factors for BB, and which one of them b) provides a better understanding (higher explained variance) of the predictive role of the risk factors for BB. The total sample was formed by N&#x02009;=&#x02009;196 college students, comprised of women (121) and men (75). The total mean age was M&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.35 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.75). The data collection used measures with acceptable psychometric properties. Among the main results, it was found that the DPM of women, when compared to the DPM of men, explained bigger amounts of variance (R2) of bulimic behavior (.48 vs. .26 ), restrained dieting (.52 vs. .27), and stress (.30 vs. .16), as well as higher beta weights in the interrelations of the risk predictive factors of BB. The structure of both models, i.e., the DPM of women and the DPM of men, allowed: a) confirmation of the theoretical proposition, which states that restrictive dieting is a predictive risk factor for BB, and b) to evaluate specifically which factor of the negative affect (stress/depression) contributes to a better understanding of the dependent variable, i. e., to gain a greater explained variance of BB.</p><p id="__p3848">Key Words. bulimic behavior, men and women, structural models, depression, stress.</p><p id="__p3849">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Gilda Gomez-Peresmitre, PhD, Faculty of Psychology, National University at Mexico, Mexico, D.F., 04510; gildag@servidor.unam.mx</p><p id="__p3850">8:48&#x000a0;AM-9:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p3851">OS18-B</p><p id="__p3852">SOCIAL COHESION INCREASES FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION IN OBESE ETHNIC MINORITY WOMEN</p><p id="__p3853">Rebecca Lee, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Renae Smith-Ray, MA,<sup>2</sup> Scherezade K.

Group dynamics based, social cohesion intervention approaches may improve adherence and participation, but little is known about ethnic minority samples. This study investigated the role of social cohesion variables in a longitudinal study to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in obese ethnic minority women. Method: African American (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;204) and Hispanic or Latina (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;105), apparently healthy, obese (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;34.5&#x000a0;kg/m2) women (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;46&#x000a0;yrs) were recruited from community sites and randomly assigned to a 6-month social cohesion intervention to promote increased vegetable and fruit consumption (VF) or comparison group. Participants completed six content-intensive social cohesion building sessions focusing on small team based activities, shared goal setting and achievement and take home activities. Sessions were conducted separately by ethnic group. Interviewer administered and self completed questionnaires measured baseline (T1) and post-intervention (T2) sociodemographic, social cohesion and dietary habits variables. BMI was measured by trained health assessors. Results: Women in the VF group reported significant increases in servings (T1 M&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.7, T2 M&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.9) compared to comparison group (T1 M&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.0, T2 M&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.2; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), regardless of ethnicity or dose. Participants also experienced significant increases in all domains of social cohesion measures (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001); however, this was not associated with outcomes. Conclusions: Obese ethnic minority women responded to dietary habits and social cohesion based interventions, regardless of ethnicity. Intervention participants consumed two servings more after treatment. Further research is needed to understand complex relationships among social cohesion variables and their change over time and how these can influence dietary habits and group adherence.

Unfortunately, few collegiate sports programs include a comprehensive nutrition component. The purpose of this study was to determine stability-reliability of a 29 item instrument created to provide baseline data that would be used to develop a multi-level nutrition program for collegiate student-athletes. This survey also included demographic questions and was based on the Health Belief Model. Questions included measures of self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility, benefits and barriers. In addition, the Stages of Change Model was used to assess current nutritional activities. The survey was administered to a convenience sample of 41 collegiate-athletes and yielded 41 matched pairs used for analysis. A single item measuring Stages of Change resulted in a moderate correlation (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.6), and 5 items on self- efficacy ranged from r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.33 -.68, for an overall moderate correlation (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.6). There were 6 items that assessed benefits of receiving sport nutrition education (range r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.2-1.0) and 7 items that measured barriers to healthy eating (range r&#x02009;=&#x02009;. .4-1.0). These items yielded a total correlation score of .6 and .7 respectively. There were 15 items that measured nutritional knowledge. Because these items were dichotomous, a Kuder Richardson 20 (KR 20) test was used. Correlation coefficients for this subscale ranged from .03 to 1.0, for an overall correlation coefficient of .52. Items with correlation scores less than .06 were modified to yield more consistent responses and thus this survey shows promise as a potential valid and reliable assessment of collegiate athletes&#x02019; knowledge, perceptions, and dietary practices. This information is essential when designing nutrition education programs and interventions for this population.</p><p id="__p3863">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Amy Thompson, PhD, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, 43606; amy.thompson4@utoledo.edu</p><p id="__p3864">9:24&#x000a0;AM-9:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p3865">OS18-D</p><p id="__p3866">DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, EMOTIONAL EATING AND OBESITY: ARE THE ASSOCIATIONS SIMILAR ACROSS SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS?</p><p id="__p3867">Hanna Konttinen, MSocSc,<sup>1</sup> Karri Silventoinen, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Sirpa Sarlio-L&#x000e4;hteenkorva, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Satu M&#x000e4;nnist&#x000f6;, PhD<sup>3</sup> and Ari Haukkala, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3868"><sup>1</sup>Department of Social Studies, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; <sup>2</sup>Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland and <sup>3</sup>Department of Chronic Disease Prevention, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.</p><p id="__p3869">Relationships between depression and obesity have been investigated extensively in the recent decades with increasing evidence of positive relationship, but few studies have examined the possible mechanisms explaining this association. The present study investigated direct and indirect associations between depressive symptoms, emotional eating and adiposity indicators across genders, and age and education groups, including whether emotional eating accounts for the association between depression and adiposity. The participants were Finnish men (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2325) and women (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2699) aged 25-74-year-old from the FINRISK 2007 Study (DILGOM substudy). Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesised associations. Depressive symptoms and emotional eating were modelled as latent factors with indicators derived from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire R-18, respectively. Participants&#x02019; body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and fat percentage were measured in a health examination. The mediation model had an adequate fit with the data with respect to all adiposity indicators in both genders. Higher depressive symptoms were related to higher levels of emotional eating (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.39 in men and &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.31 in women), and emotional eating was related to higher BMI, waist circumference and fat percentage (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.26-.30 in men and &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.22-.29 in women). The positive bivariate associations between depressive symptoms and adiposity indicators became non-significant in the models including emotional eating. Multigroup analyses indicated that there were no significant differences between genders, and age and education groups. Findings from this population-based sample indicate that emotional eating may be one factor explaining the positive relationship between depressive symptoms and obesity across different sociodemographic groups.</p><p id="__p3870">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hanna Konttinen, MSocSc, Department of Social Studies, University of Helsinki, University of Helsinki, 00014; hanna.konttinen@helsinki.fi</p><p id="__p3871">9:42&#x000a0;AM-10:00&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p3872">OS18-E</p><p id="__p3873">CONSCRIPTS&#x02019; ATTITUDES TOWARDS HEALTH AND EATING - CHANGES DURING THE MILITARY SERVICE AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH EATING PATTERNS</p><p id="__p3874">Piia Jallinoja, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Pilvikki Absetz, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Clarissa Bingham, MSci,<sup>1</sup> Antti Uutela, Professor,<sup>1</sup> Hely Tuorila, Professor<sup>2</sup> and Nelli Hankonen, LicSocSci<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3875"><sup>1</sup>National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland and <sup>2</sup>University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.</p><p id="__p3876">In total institutions such as the military, meal times serve as release from daily routines.

The aim of the study was to analyse young men&#x02019;s attitudes towards health and eating before and at military service and their associations with eating patterns. A total of 290 men (age 18-21) participating in the DefenceNutri project filled in questionnaires before service and at 6th month of service. Four sub-indexes of Health and Taste Attitude scale (HTAS) were measured: General health interest (GHI); Craving for sweet foods (CSF); Using food as a reward (REW); and Pleasure (PLE), each with 4-6 statements rated from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The food consumption was measured as the number of days/week 6 sweet foods (Sweet food index) and 6 fatty foods (Fatty foods index) were consumed. Changes of HTAS indexes were analysed with paired sample t-test and associations with eating patterns with ANOVA.</p><p id="__p3877">GHI remained stable throughout the follow-up.

The Hawaii Demonstration to Maintain Independence and Employment was a randomized controlled trial providing treatment group participants with individual life coaching and a pharmacist counseling while tracking health and employment outcomes. Self-reported diabetes self-efficacy, quality of life, functioning, hours worked, work productivity, and use of government services data were obtained at baseline, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months. Additional health information was obtained from healthcare providers. Generalized linear models for repeated measures are being used to evaluate the effect of the intervention. Surveys and focus groups were used to obtain participant perceptions about the intervention. 190 employed individuals diagnosed with diabetes or with indication of uncontrolled blood sugar were enrolled. Preliminary results show that body mass index and diabetes self-efficacy changes were significantly improved in the treatment group (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Treatment group participants reported greater work productivity improvements. Diabetes management improvements were frequently attributed to increased accountability and goal setting with a life coach, as well as nutrition and diabetes education provided by pharmacists. This presentation will discuss how participant engagement, perceptions, and intervention components may have influenced employment and health indicators. A diabetes management intervention was well received by participants and showed the potential to delay functional decline and reliance on government assistance programs. Findings have implications for employers, health care providers, and professionals using early intervention models intended to prevent disability and support the ongoing employment of individuals with chronic conditions. The use of Life Coaching and Pharmacists as counselors is an emerging service delivery approach. Further RCT research is warranted to determine the viability of this model for chronic disease management. Cost effective analysis would also be valuable.</p><p id="__p3898">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jean Isip Schneider, MEd, SPHR, Center on Disability Studies, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI, 96822; isip@hawaii.edu</p><p id="__p3899">9:06&#x000a0;AM-9:24&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p3900">OS19-C</p><p id="__p3901">THE IMPACT OF A PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL PROGRAM (SWEEP) IN DEPRESSED WOMEN WITH DIABETES</p><p id="__p3902">Sue Penckofer, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Mary Byrn, BSN,<sup>1</sup> Patricia Mumby, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Carol Ferrans, PhD,<sup>3</sup> Patrick Lustman, PhD<sup>4</sup> and Patrick Harrison, PhD<sup>5</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3903"><sup>1</sup>School of Nursing, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL; <sup>2</sup>School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL; <sup>3</sup>College of Nursing, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL; <sup>4</sup>School of Medicine, Washington University St. Louis, St. Louis, IL and <sup>5</sup>Department of Psychology, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL.</p><p id="__p3904">Depression is a serious problem affecting 25% of persons with diabetes, and the risk of depression is doubled in women compared to men with diabetes. Other moods (e.g., anxiety, anger) often accompany depression and negatively impact diabetes outcomes. We tested the feasibility of the Study of Women&#x02019;s Emotions and Evaluation of a Psychoeducational (SWEEP) program to assess the effectiveness of group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating depression and dysphoric symptoms in women with type 2 diabetes. Seventy four women with diabetes and co-morbid depression were randomized to the SWEEP program (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;34) or usual care (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;36). The treatment included 8 weekly sessions targeted at depression, anxiety, and anger. Sixty women (81%) completed baseline, 3 and 6&#x000a0;month measurements. Findings indicated a greater decrease in depression (CES-D) for the treatment (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;26.8, T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;15.2, T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.6) as compared to the control group (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;28.9, T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;23.3, T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;21.5), p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03. Similarly, there was a greater decrease in trait anxiety (STAI) (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;49.9, T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;41.2, T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;36.8) for the treatment group as compared to the control group (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;50.5, T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;46.6, T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;45.3), p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01. For anger (STAXI), although there were no significant differences between the treatment (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.0, T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.3, T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;15.4) and the control conditions at any point (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;18.0, T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;16.2, T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;16.0), there was a significant decrease in anger scores overall, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001. There was a clinically significant decrease in HBA1C in the treatment group from baseline to 3&#x000a0;months (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.6, T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.2) however, it was not statistically significant and the improvement was not sustained (T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.4). There were minimal changes in HBA1c in the control group (T1&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.9, T2&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.9, T3&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.8). Overall, the SWEEP program significantly improved depression and anxiety outcomes in depressed women with type 2 diabetes. There were also favorable effects on anger and HBA1C. These data provide the first demonstration that depression, a common co-morbidity in women with type 2 diabetes, can be effectively treated in a group setting using CBT techniques.</p><p id="__p3905">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sue Penckofer, PhD, School of Nursing, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, 60153; spencko@luc.edu</p><p id="__p3906">9:24&#x000a0;AM-9:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p3907">OS19-D</p><p id="__p3908">SHORT- AND LONG TERM EFFECTS OF A MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WITH AN ELEVATED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</p><p id="__p3909">Iris Groeneveld, MSc, Karin I.

The current study compared the efficacy of a standard behavioral weight loss maintenance intervention (SBWLM) to a novel 12-week mindfulness-based intervention plus coaching tailored to WLM (Enhancing Mindfulness for the Prevention Of WEight Regain: EMPOWER). Community members who had lost a minimum of 9% of their body weight in the previous three years were recruited and randomized. Both groups received identical information about nutrition, physical activity, the importance of stress management, and values and goal setting. The EMPOWER group, however, was presented the information in the context of learning mindfulness skills to facilitate change. EMPOWER participants were also taught meditation, mindful eating, and mindfulness strategies to reduce stress-related reactivity while SBWLM participants spent equivalent time reading and discussing relevant material. Both groups were carefully structured to ensure parity in numerous factors (e.g., time invested, peer and interventionist support, positive expectancy). Mixed models determined that incremental weight regain rates did not differ by group. On average, both groups maintained their baseline weight loss 16&#x000a0;months later, one year post intervention (EMPOWER: &#x02193; 1.5&#x000a0;kg; SBWM: &#x02191; 0.9&#x000a0;kg). Weight regain rates were equivalent to or lower than those reported in other large scale studies (e.g., Svetkey et al., 2008, Dansinger et al., 2007). Only the EMPOWER group reported increases in intuitive eating (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001), a trait previously associated with better physical health (Hawks, et al., 2005) and lower eating pathology (Tylka &#x00026; Wilcox, 2006). Further analyses will determine whether metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers were impacted differentially by group. These data support the use of the EMPOWER program as a novel and effective approach for supporting individuals in the maintenance of weight loss.</p><p id="__p3922">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Janna L.

We state and support a hypothesis here that changes in behavior rather than changes in diet and metabolism are central to MSD. We provide and discuss evidence in support of the following sequence of arguments. (i) Diet, thriftiness and obesity centered paradigm is inadequate to explain most of the physiological and immunological changes associated with metabolic syndrome disorders (MSD). (ii) Comparative studies show that relative obesity rather than absolute obesity is strongly associated with various parameters of MSD and further perception of calories without actual change in intake of calories can induce physiological changes. (iii) Alternative behavioral strategies co-exist in animal populations which are associated with characteristic metabolic states and some of these states show close resemblance with MSD in humans. (iv) Obesity and MSD are strongly and cross culturally associated with certain behavioral traits. (v) Deficiencies of certain behaviors that evolved with hunter gatherer life as adaptive behaviors but that are deficient in modern life lead to corresponding dysfunctions of neuro-endocrine mechanisms. Through a meta-analysis study we show that deficiency of physical aggression is strongly associated with MSD as seen by neuro-endocrine mechanisms as well as epidemiological data. This raises a possibility that the effects of behavioral deficiencies may be reversed by behavioral supplementation. (vi) On a pilot scale, behavioral interventions substantially ameliorated many components of MSD without significantly changing body weights. All the evidence collectively indicates that MSD originates due to behavioral deficiencies rather than metabolic thriftiness and therefore behavioral supplementation may be effective in reversing the chronic conditions.</p><p id="__p3936">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Milind Watve, PhD, IISER, Pune, Pune, 411 021; milind@iiserpune.ac.in</p><p id="__p3937">8:48&#x000a0;AM-9:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p3938">OS20-B</p><p id="__p3939">PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS OVER A LIFE COURSE AND RISK OF THE METABOLIC SYNDROME: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY</p><p id="__p3940">Jolene Masters Pedersen, master,<sup>1</sup> Ingelise Andersen, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Rikke Lund, MD, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Eva Prescott, MD<sup>2</sup> and Naja Hulvej Rod, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p3941"><sup>1</sup>Department of Social Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark and <sup>2</sup>Department of Cardiology, Bispebjerg University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p><p id="__p3942">Background: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is steadily increasing and stress has been suggested to play an important role in its etiology.

A subcohort of the intervention group (IG(2007,) participants in 2007, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;62) was followed up again 2&#x000a0;years after their participation. RESULTS: The follow-up survey 9&#x000a0;months after the beginning of the program (response rate: IG: N&#x02009;=&#x02009;163, 75.8%; CG: N&#x02009;=&#x02009;80, 94.1%) showed that 71.8% (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;117) of the intervention group could remain in work as opposed to 60.0% (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) in the control group. In the intervention group 14.7% gave up work due to OSD versus 22.5% in the control group (no statistically significant effect). In the 2-years follow-up (response rate: IG: N&#x02009;=&#x02009;172, 80%; CG: N&#x02009;=&#x02009;55, 64.7%) 58.7% (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;101) of the IG remained at work versus 29.1% (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) of the CG. In the IG 12.8% had stopped work because of OSD versus 27.3% in the CG (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, Cramer&#x02019;s V&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.26). Two years after intervention, the follow-up showed a stabilization of the effects shown by the 1-year follow-up Results: In addition to the criteria &#x02018;remaining&#x02019; or &#x02018;not remaining at work&#x02019; the results show that our interdisciplinary intervention program led to an increased and sustained knowledge on OSD and more adequate prevention at the work place in the IG. The results confirm that interdisciplinary training can be successful in effecting self-protection, behavior change against workplace hazards by using positive approaches that include the learning of "safe" behavior and insuring transferability to real workplace settings ("empowerment"). Combined preventive measures as studied in this program have recently become the standard offered by different statutory accident liability insurances for patients in different wet work occupations with OSD.</p><p id="__p3986">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sanjit R.

At 3&#x000a0;month follow up, questionnaires were completed by 63,2% and 61,2% of the participants. Work related stress was measured by the Siegrist Effort-Reward (ERI) and the Karasek Job Content (JCQ) questionnaires. Stress and outcome indicators included Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10), Carlson Work-Family Conflict (WFC), Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAIT), shortened Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Subjective somatic symptoms (PHQ15), WHO Well-being (WWB5), Rahe Life Meaning (LM).</p><p id="__p3995">During the study period, there was no change in job stress (JCQ) or effort-reward imbalance (ERI). Compared to baseline, in both intervention groups there was significant decrease in stress level (PSS10, WFC), a reduction in symptom scores (STAIT, PHQ15) and an increase in well being (WWB5, LM). Overcommitment decreased only in the long intervention group.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in a population of CLBP patients, using a psychiatric diagnostic interview.</p><p id="__p4019">Methods: 400 patients sick listed between 2 and 10&#x000a0;months for unspecific LBP were included in the study. All were recruited as part of an ongoing trial in secondary care, and were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), which is a short structured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders.</p><p id="__p4020">Results: The prevalence of current psychiatric disorders was 30%. The diagnoses included a wide range of psychiatric disorders, with the most common being major depressive disorders (4%), substance abuse (4.3%), anxiety disorders (10%), and somatoform disorders (18%). There were no gender differences in prevalence of psychiatric disorders, and no differences in mean duration of back pain between those with and without a psychiatric disorder.</p><p id="__p4021">Discussion: The results show that CLBP patients present with more psychiatric disorders than the general population, but less compared to previous studies of psychiatric comorbidity in CLBP. The difference could be a result of different compensational systems, different settings were the interviews were conducted, or different characteristics of the populations in the comparative studies.</p><p id="__p4022">Conclusion: In a large population of CLBP patients, 30% fulfilled the criteria for at least one current psychiatric disorder when measured with a diagnostic interview. The results imply that screening LBP patients for psychopathology in secondary care is important and should involve a wide range of psychiatric disorders since psychopathology might have consequences for prognosis and treatment.</p><p id="__p4023">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Silje E.

The Mexican government implemented vigorous pandemic control measures. The objective of the present study was to describe the psycho-social reactions to the epidemic, risk perception behaviors and compliance with the recommended control measures. An online questionnaire that was posted at the National University&#x02019;s Web page in May 2009, was answered by 13,690 students and employees. Knowledge, beliefs, perceptions, attitudes and behaviors in regard to both, the epidemic and the contingency, were studied. Results: 23% of the population believed that the epidemic was not real but in fact political manipulation, while 34% thought it was a new influenza strain. Worry was the most commonly reported feeling in the academic employees (74%), while students felt mainly confused or anxious (40%). The measurement of the chronological tendency of these feelings showed that at the beginning the population was mainly worried and anxious, then they felt confused, isolated and depressed, and finally they felt discriminated. Information was the most widely expressed need during the contingency and the University Web page was the most trusted source. 55% thought that the epidemic was more severe in Mexico than in other countries. The higher the perceived severity of the problem, the higher the acceptance of vigorous population control measures. Those that personally knew someone affected by the influenza A H1N1 virus were more likely to have sought the seasonal flu vaccine (OR 2.1, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Contingency had the following social impacts on daily life: impossibility to assist to public entertainment places which were closed (68%), interruption of academic work (60%), increased time with the family (50%), more frequent hand washing (91%) and mask wearing (66%). Immediate behavioral research must be considered within epidemic preparedness plans.</p><p id="__p4078">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Claudia Infante, DSc, School of Medicine, National University of Mexico, Mexico City, 14000; claudiainfante@prodigy.net.mx</p><p id="__p4079">9:06&#x000a0;AM-9:24&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4080">OS23-C</p><p id="__p4081">AN INTERVENTION TO ENCOURAGE ACTIVITY AND HEALTHY EATING IN PEOPLE RECOVERING FROM RECENT-ONSET PSYCHOSIS</p><p id="__p4082">Alison J.

We aimed to design and test an intervention to encourage exercise and healthy eating in this group.</p><p id="__p4085">Our development work included a systematic review of previous randomised controlled trials of healthy living interventions, to determine which aspects of interventions had been successful previously. We interviewed service-users and case-managers to determine preferences, accessibility and feasibility of different models.

However, the contribution of sleep problems to weight gain is poorly understood. We examined sleep problems as predictors of subsequent weight gain.</p><p id="__p4095">Methods: Data were derived from baseline (2000-2002, response rate 67%) and follow-up (2007, response rate 83%) postal questionnaires surveys (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7330, aged 40-60&#x000a0;years). At baseline, all participants were employed by the City of Helsinki, Finland. The follow-up questionnaire surveys were mailed to all those who returned the baseline questionnaire. Weights and heights were self-reported. Those who had gained at least five kilograms during the follow-up were examined as reporting major weight gain. Sleep problems were measured by problems maintaining and initiating sleep, and non-restorative sleep during the previous month. Logistic regression models were fitted, adjusting for age, baseline body mass index, socio-demographic background, health behaviours, health status, sleep duration, and shift work.</p><p id="__p4096">Results: Altogether 26% of women and 24% of men had gained at least five kilograms during the follow-up. Sleep problems at least three times a week (20% of women and 17% of men) were associated with major weight gain among women after adjusting for age (OR 1.41; CI 95% 1.13-1.75). The adjustments for baseline body mass index, marital status, education, heavy drinking, current smoking, physical activity, limiting long standing illness, sleep duration, and shift work had practically no effect on the association. However, adjustment for baseline mental disorders attenuated the association. Among men, none of the associations were statistically significant.</p><p id="__p4097">Conclusions: Sleep problems remained associated with weight gain among women after pertinent risk factors have been accounted for. Associations among men and the effects of co-occurrence of mental health problems need to be confirmed in further studies. Promoting better sleep and preventing sleep problems might help prevent weight gain and subsequent health risks.</p><p id="__p4098">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Tea Lallukka, PhD, Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, 00014; tea.lallukka@helsinki.fi</p><p id="__p4099">9:42&#x000a0;AM-10:00&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4100">OS23-E</p><p id="__p4101">EVALUATION OF A SELF-HELP PROGRAM IN ACUTE TINNITUS</p><p id="__p4102">Nele Nyenhuis, Dipl-Psych,<sup>1</sup> Sarah Zastrutzki, Dipl,-Psych,<sup>2</sup> Cornelia Weise, Dr,<sup>2,3</sup> Burkard Jaeger, Dr<sup>2</sup> and Birgit Kroener-Herwig, Dr<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p4103"><sup>1</sup>Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Georg-August-Universit&#x000e4;t G&#x000f6;ttingen, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Department of Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany and <sup>3</sup>Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning, Link&#x000f6;ping University, Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden.</p><p id="__p4104">Tinnitus can lead to a substantial decline in psychological well-being. Existing treatments focus mainly on chronic tinnitus-sufferers, but treatment in the acute phase seems also desirable to prevent a decompensation. The aim of this study was to develop a self-help program for acute tinnitus-sufferers and to evaluate its efficacy. Participants were 18 to 75&#x000a0;years old and had suffered a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of 6&#x000a0;months from subjective tinnitus. They were randomly assigned to either a CBT-based self-help treatment (internet- or paper-based, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;68) or a control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;38). Some basic information about tinnitus was given to members of the control group, none of which was relevant to treatment.</p><p id="__p4105">Tinnitus distress and coping abilities were measured as main outcomes. Assessments were performed via self-report inventories at entry and after 3&#x000a0;months. Results of a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed that overall tinnitus distress improved in both groups over time (F (104) = 40.27, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.000, Eta2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.28). In addition, the intervention condition led to more extended improvement than the control condition (F (104) = 12.56, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001, Eta2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.11). In both groups use of helpful self-instructions became more likely over time (F(99) = 5.86, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.017, Eta2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.06) while unhelpful self-instructions decreased (F (99) = 15.59, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.000, Eta2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.17). Between-group comparison showed that participants in the self-help program reported more helpful self-instructions (F(99) = 5.66, p.&#x02009;=&#x02009;.019, Eta2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05) and fewer unhelpful self-instructions (F (99) = 5.78, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.018, Eta2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.06) than controls. Post-hoc tests revealed no differences between internet-based and paper-based intervention and the control condition.</p><p id="__p4106">The results indicate that the self-help manual leads to additional improvement regarding tinnitus distress and enhances coping-abilities.

Therapist delivered, manualised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in treating MS fatigue. The purpose of this study was to develop and pilot the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based version of this CBT package.</p><p id="__p4123">Methods: The MS-Invigor8 programme was developed over 9&#x000a0;months by a team of software developers, psychologists and people with MS. 40 patients with MS fatigue were then randomised to the web intervention in conjunction with 3 therapy phone calls (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) or a wait list control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17). Patients were assessed using standardised self-report measures of fatigue severity and impact pre-randomisation and 10&#x000a0;weeks later. They also completed measures of health care use and quality of life for the economics analysis. Patients in the intervention group were interviewed to see how they had experienced the treatment approach.</p><p id="__p4124">Results: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients randomised to MS-Invigor8 reported significantly greater reductions on the Fatigue Scale (F(3,36) = 16.59, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (F(3,34) = 17.15, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) at 10&#x000a0;weeks than those on the wait list. The QALY gain based on the EQ-5D was 0.015 higher in the intervention group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.038), but there were no differences in service use between the groups. The mean number of sessions completed in the intervention group was 5 out of 8. Qualitative data suggested that most patients found the programme and telephone sessions helpful, had made lifestyle modifications to manage their fatigue, felt they were more in control of their fatigue and had greater understanding of this symptom. Modifications were suggested to further improve the programme.</p><p id="__p4125">Discussion: This pilot study suggests that computerised CBT may be an effective, accessible and acceptable intervention for managing fatigue in MS. The improvements in quality of life and the relatively low cost of the intervention highlight the potential for it to be a cost-effective way of offering CBT to this group.</p><p id="__p4126">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Rona Moss-Morris, PhD, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO171RE; remm@soton.ac.uk</p><p id="__p4127">SS17d</p><p id="__p4128">ASSESSING PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME AND MEDIATORS OF CHANGE IN CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME AFTER COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY</p><p id="__p4129">Trudie Chalder, PhD, MSc</p><p id="__p4130">Psychological Medicine, King&#x02019;s College London, London, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p4131">Background: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).

This study sought to determine the impact of tailored navigation on CRC screening in primary care.</p><p id="__p4143">Methods: The study included 154 primary care practice patients who were 50 or more years of age, were eligible for CRC screening, and had an office visit within two years prior to study initiation. Baseline telephone survey data were collected on participant sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, and screening test (fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or colonoscopy) decision stage. By comparing decision stage data, we identified that test with the highest decision stage (i.e., preferred screening test). Participants who preferred FOBT were sent an FOBT kit and a reminder. Those preferring colonoscopy were sent colonoscopy instructions. After this mailing, a study patient navigator made a telephone call to guide participants towards screening. Six-month endpoint survey and medical records data were obtained. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors of screening and of change in preferred screening test decision stage.</p><p id="__p4144">Results: At endpoint, 63 (41%) study participants had screened.

Also in 2007, the Alberta Colorectal Cancer Screening Program was launched, an initiative recommending all provincial residents be tested annually with FOBT (beginning at age 50) while in 2008, the Forzani and MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre, opened in Calgary ( Alberta) the only non-hospital Canadian colon cancer screening facility. In Canada, only 40% report being up-to-date CRC screening using FOBT or endoscopy, with FOBT compliance especially suboptimal. The Canadian Institute for Health Research Team in Population-based Colorectal Cancer Screening was accordingly funded to investigate CRC screening activities in several provinces and to originate multiple activities, notably focus groups aimed at ascertaining optimal methods for promoting FOBT-CRC and Targeted and Tailored- Navigated Intervention Trials that directly test specific approaches to increasing screening uptake. In this presentation, a range of findings will be shared, as related to regionally-diverse Focus Group Studies, pilot studies of invitation letter promotions on a provincial basis (Ontario) and to individuals awaiting colonoscopies (Alberta); and Tailored-Navigation interventions directed at attendees of a large primary care practice where patient navigators undertake promotion/information related to screening promotion.

A revision of the classification of somatoform disorders seems necessary, although there is continuing discussion what should be revised in detail. Joel Dimsdale, the speaker of the DSM-V work group, will present the latest DSM-V proposal for the classification of somatic symptoms causing significant psychological distress, and empirical data supporting this new classification approach. Per Fink and colleagues will provide data from Denmark indicating one new approach to tackle diagnostic problems of somatoform disorders, and its empirical validation. New frontiers of interventions are reported by A. Schr&#x000f6;der who focus on functional somatic symptoms. The presentation of Arthur Barsky will finally address the different nature of somatic symptoms, and especially the distinction between nonpathological bodily discomfort versus psychopathological features that need to be diagnosed. The symposium will result in a discussion of future options for classification and treatment of this prevalent and costly medical condition.</p><p id="__p4166">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Winfried Rief, PhD, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Marburg, Marburg, 35032; rief@staff.uni-marburg.de</p><p id="__p4167">SS19a</p><p id="__p4168">RETHINKING SOMATIZATION; WHAT&#x02019;S NORMAL AND WHAT&#x02019;S NOT</p><p id="__p4169">Arthur Barsky, MD</p><p id="__p4170">Brigham &#x00026; Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Boston, MA.</p><p id="__p4171">Medically unexplained somatic symptoms may result from many sources other than psychiatric disorder, and somatization therefore is not by definition psychopathological. Such symptoms are a final common pathway for the expression of situational, intrapsychic, behavioral, interpersonal and sociocultural distress. Symptoms without a serious medical cause are a nearly universal human experience, arising in the daily lives of perfectly healthy people. Some are a non-verbal interpersonal communication in which the individual seeks the acknowledgment from others that they are in distress and suffering, hoping thereby to secure special attention, support, and consideration. For some patients, a lifetime of medically unexplained complaints can be best conceptualized as a stable personality trait, one that has been associated with other enduring personality characteristics. Somatization can also be understood as a form of illness and sick role behavior -- not something an individual has, but rather something he/she does. Alternatively, emotional distress, particularly when combined with certain early childhood experiences of trauma, adversity or deprivation, can generate somatic symptoms. Preoccupied and fearful attachment styles that are learned in childhood can also lead to somatization in adulthood.</p><p id="__p4172">The presentation of medically unexplained symptoms is also subject to socio-cultural influences. Cultural norms and values encourage the expression of distress in certain forms and discourage it in others; these cultural forces shape the experience and reporting of bodily symptoms by influencing how they are identified, interpreted, described and reported. Finally, the search for neurobiological mechanisms of somatization is under way, implicating the hyperresponsivity of centrally acting proinflammatory cytokines, dysregulation of central and peripheral serotonergic systems, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.</p><p id="__p4173">It is only when these medically unexplained symptoms are recurrent, especially distressing, severe, prolonged, and disabling that they may be considered psychopathological.</p><p id="__p4174">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Arthur Barsky, MD, Brigham &#x00026; Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115; abarsky@partners.org</p><p id="__p4175">SS19b</p><p id="__p4176">DOES THE BODILY DISTRESS SYNDROME DIAGNOSIS UNIFY THE FUNCTIONAL SOMATIC SYNDROMES AND SOMATOFORM DISORDERS?</p><p id="__p4177">Per Fink, DMSc, PhD and Andreas Schr&#x000f6;der, MD</p><p id="__p4178">The Research Clinic for Functional Disorders and Psychosomatics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.</p><p id="__p4179">Background: In order to clarify the classification of physical complaints not attributable to verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, a new diagnosis of Bodily distress syndrome was introduced. The aim of this study was to test if patients diagnosed with one of six different functional somatic syndromes or a DSM-IV somatoform disorder were captured by the new diagnosis.</p><p id="__p4180">Method: A stratified sample of 978 consecutive patients from neurological (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;120) and medical (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;157) departments and from primary care (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;701) was examined applying post-hoc diagnoses based on the SCAN diagnostic instrument. Diagnoses were assigned only to clinically relevant cases, i.e. patients with impairing illness.</p><p id="__p4181">Results: Bodily distress syndrome included all patients with Fibromyalgia (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;58), Chronic fatigue syndrome (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;54) and Hyperventilation syndrome (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;49), 98 % of those with Irritable bowel syndrome (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;43) and at least 90% of patients with Non-cardiac chest pain (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;129), Pain syndrome (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;130) or any somatoform disorder (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;178).

One of the workgroups has been charged to review somatoform disorders, a group of disorders of special relevance to behavioral medicine. Feedback from the audience is sought concerning the proposed changes.</p><p id="__p4191">Somatoform disorders have been problematic in the current diagnostic schema. The term itself is confusing. Somatoform disorders are rarely diagnosed although they are frequently encountered in medical practice. The diagnosis tends to emphasize constructs such as &#x0201c;medically unexplained symptoms,&#x0201d; thereby basing the diagnosis on negative rather than positive manifestations. Patients regard the terminology as offensive. It is difficult to understand the prevalence and treatment of such disorders as long as a hierarchical decision model prevents diagnosing these disorders when other psychiatric disorders are present.</p><p id="__p4192">The workgroup feels that the hallmark of such disorders is the presence of somatic symptoms associated with significant distress and/or dysfunction. These disorders typically present first in non-psychiatric settings. Somatic symptoms are common in every day life &#x00026; may be initiated, exacerbated or maintained by combinations of biological, psychological and social factors. Somatic symptom disorders can accompany diverse general medical as well as psychiatric diagnoses. When criteria are fulfilled, for example, for major affective disorder and for complex somatic symptom disorder, both diagnoses should be coded.</p><p id="__p4193">Major changes are summarized below:</p><p id="__p4194">1. move &#x0201c;Psychological Factors Affecting a Medical Condition&#x0201d; from &#x0201c;other factors that may be of interest.&#x0201d;</p><p id="__p4195">2. introduce a new diagnosis &#x0201c;Complex Somatic Symptom Disorder.&#x0201d; This disorder is characterized by multiple somatic symptoms, as well as misattributions, excessive concern or preoccupation with symptoms &#x00026; illness. The workgroup feels that this rubric accurately describes disorders such as somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and pain disorder.</p><p id="__p4196">3. The workgroup proposes changes to criteria for conversion disorders. Most notably, we recommend removing the requirement for psychological factors to be associated with symptom onset. This matter is difficult to establish. There is currently discussion regarding whether conversion disorder is most usefully aligned with somatic symptom disorders or anxiety disorders.</p><p id="__p4197">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Joel Dimsdale, MD, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0804; jdimsdale@ucsd.edu</p><p id="__p4198">\n<strong>Friday</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4199">\n<strong>August 6, 2010</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4200">\n<strong>PAPER SESSIONS</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4201">\n<strong>10:30&#x000a0;AM-12:00&#x000a0;PM</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4202">OS24</p><p id="__p4203">10:30&#x000a0;AM-10:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4204">OS24-A</p><p id="__p4205">ELABORATING THE TARGETS FOR A PRACTICE INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE OPPORTUNISTIC CHLAMYDIA SCREENING BY GP PRACTICES</p><p id="__p4206">Louise M.

The National Chlamydia Screening Programme aimed to increase screening of sexually active 15-24&#x000a0;year olds. Half of PCT&#x02019;s are under-performing against the Department of Health&#x02019;s target for all Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to screen 18% of this population. Therefore there is a need to improve opportunistic screening in GP practices. As part of a wider project to develop an intervention this study assesses individual staff attitudes and intentions to screening, and informs the content of the intervention.</p><p id="__p4209">Method: A theory based survey was developed from previous qualitative and quantitative data from practice staff. The survey was administered to clinical and non-clinical staff in GP surgeries; of which 466 had been returned</p><p id="__p4210">Findings: Intention to offer Chlamydia screening was high (mean 5.50, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.07). Subjective norms and PBC scores were also high (mean 6.01, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.16; mean 6.24, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;.82 respectively), with attitude similarly positive (5.97 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;.75). Linear regression analysis showed that intention significantly predicted approximately 13% variation in behaviour in clinical staff (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;34.708, AdjR2&#x02009;=&#x02009;.131, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) but was insignificant for non-clinical staff. Attitude and subjective norms were the most significant predictors of intention (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.005) whilst PBC did not significantly predict intention.</p><p id="__p4211">Discussion: Intention to offer screens is directly related to actual behaviour, and those who have more positive attitudes and perceive their colleagues to be more approving are more likely to offer screens. The lack of predictive power with non-clinical staff may reflect their view that offering information is beyond their role, and thus it is important to raise awareness of the value of doing so.</p><p id="__p4212">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Louise M.

There is also a need for more research on effective training approaches.

We used data from the American Association of Diabetes Educators Outcome System, implemented in eight DSM education programs in western Pennsylvania, to examine the bivariate relationship between adherence to the DSM regimen and SE in changing specific behaviors and general SE in DSM among patients with type 2 diabetes. DSM regimen adherence was measured as the frequency with which patients followed their recommended DSM regimen, including medication taking, diet, exercise, and self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG]). Behavior-specific SE was measured by asking patients their level of confidence in making changes in these four DSM behaviors. Higher scores indicated greater adherence or confidence. General SE in DSM was measured by asking &#x0201c;How sure are you that you can manage your diabetes?&#x0201d; with four responses (A lot/ some/ a little/ not at all). We used correlation and simple linear regression to analyze the data. The sample (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;709) was 88.3% white and 53.8% female, with a mean age of 58.2&#x000a0;years and an average of 7.9&#x000a0;years since diagnosis of diabetes. We observed a stronger relationship with SE in changing diet (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.29, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and exercise (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.21, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and the corresponding adherence behaviors than we found between DSM self-efficacy and adherence to diet (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.14, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and exercise (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.10, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). These associations remained significant after controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, education, family history, and time since diagnosis. Medication adherence was weakly correlated with SE in DSM (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.09, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02) but not medication-specific SE (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.25, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.08). No associations were found between general or specific SE measures and SMBG (ps&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.05). Further evidence is needed to confirm our results in a research setting. Our findings suggest that promoting patients&#x02019; confidence in managing their diabetes, especially with respect to making changes in diet and exercise could improve patient adherence to their recommended diabetes self-management regimen.</p><p id="__p4230">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jing Wang, BSN, PhDc, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261; jiw38@pitt.edu</p><p id="__p4231">11:24&#x000a0;AM-11:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4232">OS24-D</p><p id="__p4233">UK CLINICIANS&#x02019; MOTIVATION TOWARDS USING SELF MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PRACTICES WHEN WORKING WITH PATIENTS WITH LONG TERM CONDITIONS</p><p id="__p4234">Louise M.

Patients seeking help in primary care often exhibit a wide variety of problems with both somatic and psychological symptoms. The role of primary care has also changed in relation to psychiatry in that it now constitutes the first-order treatment for psychiatric disorders. A bio-psychosocial perspective, increased knowledge of behavioural medicine and improved inter-professional collaboration all offer a viable response to this situation. Inter-professional courses at the advanced undergraduate level provide opportunities for inter-professional learning, a learning about, and with one another. At Karolinska Institutet, a cross-program elective course in applied behavioural medicine has been offered since the fall of 2006, first for medical and psychology students, and since 2008 also for physiotherapy students. This presentation describes the course structure and presents evaluation results from the five-week inter-professional course between 2006 and 2009.</p><p id="__p4248">Results and discussion: In 2006 and 2007 the course was held with medicine and psychology students; in 2008, only physiotherapy and clinical psychology students were recruited. Medical students did not apply due to new program changes. All three groups have been very satisfied with the course, experiencing it as an important complement to their undergraduate education. It has been rewarding to train themselves to communicate and interact around the patient&#x02019;s problems from each separate perspective. Individual professional roles have become clearer, and all indicate their conviction of the need for inter-professional collaboration. Evaluation of attitudes toward other professional groups showed that only psychology students changed their perceptions of physicians and physiotherapists during the course.</p><p id="__p4249">Conclusion: Inter-professional courses at the advanced undergraduate level offer a useful meeting between the different professions and can therefore be an important step in applying bio-psychosocial model to work in practice. Results will also be presented from the 2009-10 courses where registered and professionally active physiotherapists, doctors and psychologists have also been recruited as course participants alongside the undergraduate students.</p><p id="__p4250">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anne H Berman, PhD, Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, S-14104; anne.h.berman@ki.se</p><p id="__p4251">OS25</p><p id="__p4252">10:30&#x000a0;AM-10:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4253">OS25-A</p><p id="__p4254">THE EFFECTS OF PARENTING BEHAVIOR ON MENTAL HEALTH OF DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</p><p id="__p4255">Luke Yang, PhD</p><p id="__p4256">Department of Social Welfare, Hsuan Chuang university, Hsinchu, Taiwan.</p><p id="__p4257">Disadvantaged children and adolescents need more supportive care, and most studies show that parenting plays a significant role in explaining mental health among them.

A psychosocial intervention study aimed at reducing parents and child&#x02019;s level of distress identified a group of parents with an immediate, extended need for psychosocial intervention.</p><p id="__p4265">Patients: Parents to 25 HSCT children were included in a psychosocial intervention study during the child&#x02019;s admission. The intervention included daily psychosocial support.</p><p id="__p4266">Methods: Case study combined interviews and observational study.</p><p id="__p4267">Results: Parents to 8 of the 25 children had complex psychosocial problems which impaired their ability to support and care for their child during hospitalisation and after discharge. The parent&#x02019;s were characterised by: 1) low level income 2) low level education 3) low level support 4) marginal relationship to the work market 5) physical illness 6) psychiatric illness 7) non-western ethnicity and 8) Danish as a second language. Parents of the 8 children had 4 or more of the 8 characteristics, which place them at risk of social exclusion. These parents needed individual interventions such as 1) help to understand the child&#x02019;s HSCT treatment 2) the child&#x02019;s reactions&#x000a0;3) extended emotional support 4) help to facilitate communicate with the welfare system 5) additional economical support and 5) additional help to care for the child.</p><p id="__p4268">Conclusion: Parents&#x02019; prior psychosocial situation in conjunction with the strain of caring for a HSCT child exceeds the parent&#x02019;s resources, being the reason why psychosocial interventions are required so the child&#x02019;s health is not placed at an additional risk.</p><p id="__p4269">Parents of HSCT children at risk of social exclusion experience difficulties with manoeuvring within the welfare-based system, which increases their risk of social exclusion.</p><p id="__p4270">Psychosocial screening and interventions to parents of HSCT children is recommended.</p><p id="__p4271">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hanne B.

Boys with a depressed mother had a 4.5 times higher odds (unadjusted) of having a high conduct score (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and a two and half times higher odds (unadjusted) of a high hyperactivity score (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) compared with boys whose mothers were not depressed. Girls with a depressed mother had a 4 times higher odds (unadjusted) of a high conduct score (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and a three-fold higher odds (unadjusted) of a high hyperactivity score (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) compared with girls whose mothers were not depressed. The relationship was tested using logistic regression models controlling for child and parent characteristics, socio-economic circumstance and parenting behaviors. The odds for both boys and girls of depressed mother having a high conduct score remained significantly higher compared to boys and girls of non-depressed mothers but were attenuated to two-fold higher odds. The odds of boys with a depressed mother having a high hyperactivity score remained significantly higher compared to boys of non-depressed mothers but decreased to a one and half times higher odds, whilst for girls the relationship was no longer significant.</p><p id="__p4291">Conclusion: The relationship between maternal depression and a high conduct and hyperactivity score in 3&#x000a0;year old boys and a high conduct score in girls is not wholly accounted for by socio-economic circumstance or parenting behaviors and therefore other mechanisms are likely to be additionally important.</p><p id="__p4292">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Caroline M.

Empirical evidence on the effects of maternal employment on children is contradictory and has little work has considered the impact of maternal employment within the context of the employment patterns of both parents.</p><p id="__p4299">Objectives and methods: This study examines the effects of parental employment in the early years on child socio-emotional behavior at age 5 in a recent birth cohort study in the United Kingdom. Participants of the Millennium Cohort Study were born between September 2000 and January 2002 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18,819). Data on parental employment across three sweeps of data collection (infancy, age 3 and age 5) were used to investigate: (i) whether children whose mothers were in paid work during their first five years were more likely than children whose mothers were at home full-time to display adverse behavioral symptoms at age 5, independent of maternal education, mental health or economic position; (ii) whether effects of maternal employment on child socio-emotional development were cumulative in nature, or whether children were more sensitive to the effects of maternal employment during their first year; and (iii) the effects of different types of parental work arrangements on child socio-emotional behavior at age 5. Child socio-emotional behavior was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire with clinically relevant cut-points for problem behaviors.</p><p id="__p4300">Results: No evidence of detrimental effects of maternal employment in the early years on subsequent child socio-emotional behavior was seen. There were significant gender differences in the effects of parental work arrangements on behavioral outcomes. Girls whose mothers were not in paid work during their first five years were 77% (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.21-2.57) more likely to have behavioral difficulties at age 5 than girls whose mothers were in paid work throughout their early years, independent of maternal characteristics and household income. For boys this was not the case, but boys in two-parent households in which their father was not in paid work for at least one period during their first five years were at an increased risk for behavioral problems at age 5. The most beneficial working arrangement for both girls and boys was that in which both mothers and fathers were present in the household and in paid work, independent of parental educational attainment and household income.</p><p id="__p4301">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anne McMunn, PhD, MPH, Epidemiology &#x00026; Public Health, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT; a.mcmunn@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="__p4302">\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583828887488" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figal_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figal_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figal_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583828887488" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p4303">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Ole S.

A case control study with matched age, sex and education, based on a two group pre- and post-test design was adopted. Participants of the experimental group were 9 CHD patients (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;56.33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.45, male 67%) who attended a weekly two-and-a-half hour session and did homework for two months. The intervention foci included psycho-education, biofeedback-assistant relaxation training, and cognitive-behavior strategies to reduce the levels of hostility affect, hostility cognition, and hostility behavior. Participants of the control group were 13 CHD patients (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;59.23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.80, male 69%) who did not receive any psychological treatment until they finished the three-month waiting status.

Survey data indicate that herbal therapies and mind-body therapies are most commonly used. One such treatment option is qigong. Several reviews have claimed that qigong has therapeutic effects on blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, these reviews are non-systematic and therefore open to bias. To systematically assess the clinical evidence of qigong for hypertension. Databases were searched up to December 2009. All randomised clinical trials testing qigong in patients with hypertension of any origin and assessing clinically relevant outcomes were considered. Trials using any type of control intervention were included. The selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by at least two reviewers. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Jadad score. 12 RCTs could be included. Seven of these RCTs tested qigong in combination with antihypertensive drugs compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. The meta-analysis of four trials reporting adequate data suggested beneficial effects in favour of qigong (weighted mean difference, systolic blood pressure (mmHg) -12.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -17.12 to -7.00; diastolic blood pressure -8.46, 95% CI -12.55 to -4.37). Qigong alone was compared with waiting list control in 2 RCTs and was found to significantly reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (mmHg) -18.46, 95% CI -23.07 to -13.86). In further three RCTs comparisons made were: qigong combined with antihypertensive drugs versus muscle relaxation combined with antihypertensive drugs; qigong as a sole treatment versus exercise and/or antihypertensive drugs, all reported positive results in at least some of the relevant outcome measures. The methodological quality of the original studies was low. There is some encouraging evidence to suggest that qigong is effective for lowering systolic blood pressure. However, the conclusiveness of these findings is limited. Rigorously designed trials seem warranted to confirm these results.</p><p id="__p4317">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Myeong Soo Lee, PhD, Division of Standard Research, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, 305-811; drmslee@gmail.com</p><p id="__p4318">11:24&#x000a0;AM-11:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4319">OS26-D</p><p id="__p4320">EFFECTIVENESS OF A DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT AND SECONDARY PREVENTION PROGRAM ON FUNCTIONING AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS FOLLOWING MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: THE MOOD-CARE TRIAL</p><p id="__p4321">Adrienne O&#x02019;Neil, BA Hons,<sup>1</sup> Kristy Sanderson, BSc (Hons) PhD,<sup>2</sup> Bianca Chan, BSc BA MPH<sup>1</sup> and Brian F.

In Latin American, CHF is one of the main causes of cardiovascular mortality. In Colombia, it is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death. Cardiac rehabilitation programs aimed at individuals with CHF are designed to decrease morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life (QOL). Little data is available on the impact of cardiac rehabilitation programs on QOL in CHF patients in Colombia. The SF-36, a self-report instrument validated in Spanish with 8 sub-scales and a question regarding Health Expectations, was used to measure QOL in 35 CHF patients participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program at St. Vincent de Paul Hospital in Medell&#x000ed;n, Colombia at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups. The rehabilitation program consisted of 12-session treatment protocol including exercise, occupational therapy, and psycho-education. One-way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for each QOL sub-scale. Results indicated that CHF patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation significantly improved their Physical Performance sub-scale scores and Health Expectations score over time (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 and p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 respectively). Cardiac rehabilitation CHF patients also tended to have improved General Health sub-scale scores and Physical Functioning sub-scale scores over time (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09 respectively). Scores on the remaining SF-36 sub-scales (Pain, Emotional Performance, Social Functioning, Mental Health, and Vitality) did not vary over time (p = NS). A cardiac rehabilitation directed at CHF patients appears to improve specific physical health-related domains of QOL, although future research involving a control group would strengthen these Results: The findings suggest the need for psychologists, nurses, and other health professionals to integrate psychosocial aspects into existing cardiac rehabilitation program in order to potentially improve other domains of QOL in Colombian patients with CHF.</p><p id="__p4333">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Heather Rogers, PhD, MPH, Department of Social and Behavioral Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, 23233; hlrogers@vcu.edu</p><p id="__p4334">OS27</p><p id="__p4335">10:30&#x000a0;AM-10:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4336">OS27-A</p><p id="__p4337">IMPLEMENTATION TRIAL OF AN AUTOMATED TELEPHONE SYSTEM TARGETING DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT</p><p id="__p4338">Dominique Bird, MD,<sup>1</sup> Brian Oldenburg, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Mandy Cassimatis, Grad Dip Psych,<sup>2</sup> Anthony Russell, PhD<sup>2</sup> and Robert H.

We also assessed program satisfaction and perceived efficacy of training using qualitative (i.e., focus group) and quantitative approaches.</p><p id="__p4352">Results: All participants achieved the criteria for all four competency domains. On the first attempt 75%, 75%, 63%, and 75% passed the diabetes knowledge, empowerment-based facilitation skills, active listening skills, and self-efficacy, respectively. Participants who failed at least one competency domain on the first attempt successfully passed on the second attempt. Participants were generally satisfied with the program length, training session length, balance between content and skills development, and preparation for leading group and individual-based support activities.</p><p id="__p4353">Conclusion: Findings suggest that it is feasible to train and to graduate PLs with the diabetes-related knowledge, communication skills, and facilitation skills needed to lead ongoing DSMS interventions. Subsequent research should examine the impact of this peer-led DSMS model on improving patients&#x02019; diabetes-related health outcomes.</p><p id="__p4354">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Tricia S.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the affective states: happiness, anxiety and depression, alongside self efficacy and eating behaviours. It further aimed to identify if these components influence overeating behaviour, a factor that is empirically linked to a high BMI (Macht, 2008).</p><p id="__p4361">Method: Data was collected from 104 adults (76% female), mean age 38.48 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.47) years, who completed questionnaires which measured happiness, depression, anxiety, generalised self efficacy, dietary restraint, emotional eating and binge eating. Height and weight were also taken to calculate BMI, which ranged from 16.41-44.38 with a mean BMI of 26.92 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.98).</p><p id="__p4362">Results: Findings confirm that there are significant relationships between personal control, affective states, eating behaviours and BMI.

Controlling for age and gender, generalised self efficacy explained the variance in emotional eating by 16%, binge eating by 12% and BMI by 19%. Dietary restraint accounted for 66% of the variance in binge eating behaviour and was also the highest predictor of BMI (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.45), with depression explaining a further 9%. Finally, investigating the influence of emotional eating, negative affect (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.32) and dietary restraint (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.07) were revealed to be the most significant predictors.</p><p id="__p4363">Conclusion: Evidence presented here highlights the importance for behavioural medicine to consider the influence of self efficacy and affect when tailoring weight loss interventions, while also exercising caution over the negative influence of dieting behaviour.</p><p id="__p4364">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Angel Chater, PhD, Psychology, University of Bedfordshire, Bedfordshire, LU1 3JU; angel.chater@beds.ac.uk</p><p id="__p4365">11:24&#x000a0;AM-11:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4366">OS27-E</p><p id="__p4367">CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS IN TRANSLATING &#x0201c;DIABETES CARE IN AMERICAN SAMOA&#x0201d;</p><p id="__p4368">Rochelle K.

Formative qualitative research is often used to translate interventions developed for one population to another. We review the role of qualitative methods in &#x0201c;Diabetes Care in American Samoa&#x0201d; a clinical trial of a CHW-delivered intervention.</p><p id="__p4371">Methods: Formative research included 14 individual interviews (IDI) with medical clinic staff, 6 focus groups (FG) with 39 diabetes patients and 10 cognitive interviews (CI), also with diabetes patients. IDIs and FGs inquired on barriers or facilitators of diabetes care and sought input on planned intervention components. CIs explored the effectiveness and cultural relevancy of a subset of quantitative survey items. NVivo software was used for data management; relevant themes were identified and applied to the Precede-Proceed model to adapt intervention materials.</p><p id="__p4372">Results: Analysis identified barriers to diabetes self care including preferences for high fat foods, consumption of large quantities at social gatherings, and social expectations to eat large amounts. Facilitators included extended family networks, respect for doctors, and strong religious faith used in support of self care. CIs confirmed linguistic translations, with accommodations for relevant cultural examples within items.</p><p id="__p4373">The research practice of identifying barriers and facilitators of healthy behavior does not view those cultural elements the way participants do. Therefore, we have also sought to understand how participants see these same behaviors, including their variability.</p><p id="__p4374">Conclusions: Identifying the cultural meaning of self care-related behaviors is important to designing interventions to address them; qualitative methods are extremely valuable for identifying key cultural features on which to adapt intervention delivery models, materials and measures.</p><p id="__p4375">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Rochelle K.

Of these, 3863 were successfully followed up in the second Wave in late 2007 (with a retention rate of 81.6%). Baseline measures of sociodemographics, dependence and interest in quitting were used prospectively to predict both making quit attempts and quit success.</p><p id="__p4384">Overall, 979 out of the 3863 (25.3%) Chinese smokers reported having made at least one quit attempt between Waves 1 and 2; of these, 212 (21.7%) were still stopped at Wave 2. Independent predictors of making quit attempts included having higher quitting self-efficacy, previous quit attempts, some intention to quit, disagreeing that s/he enjoyed smoking too much to quit, and having very negative opinion of smoking. Independent predictors of quit success among those who attempted were having longer previous abstinence from smoking (7&#x000a0;months or more), and having greater interest in quitting (planning to quit within 1&#x000a0;month).</p><p id="__p4385">Compared to other countries fewer adult smokers in China attempt to quit and predictors vary: with measure of nicotine dependence less predictive and, like in Malaysia and Thailand, interest in quitting more predictive of success.

A half-BPD provides no drug but only placebo. Methods: Sixty-four healthy subjects (32:32 males:females, 24&#x000a0;years) balanced for smokers and never-smokers were made to believe that a chewing gum they received may or may not contain 4&#x000a0;mg nicotine to improve vigilance and reaction time, while in fact all received placebo. The experimenter conducting the study was also made to believe this was a fully BPD to maintain double-blindness. Immediately prior to neurocognitive function testing (N-back tasks with three levels of difficulties and two consecutive runs) they were informed that they belong to the nicotine group or to the placebo group. Dependent measures were reaction time (RT, ms) and number of false go (GO) and no-go (NGO) responses. Results: A significant (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.028) interaction of all five factors (within: level of difficulty, runs; between: information, smoking status, gender) and age as covariate was found indicating that the information to receive nicotine shortened RT in male, but not in female smokers, while in non-smokers, the information prolonged RT, specifically in males. The placebo information produced no differences in RT in smokers/nonsmokers and in males/females. The differential effects on RT were more pronounced with a high cognitive demand, and during the second run. No effect of any of the factors was found for the number of GO and NGO errors. Conclusion: The known effects of nicotine on RT can be mimicked by the belief to receive nicotine, but males are more prone then females to respond to such information. Never-smokers, in contrast experience opposite effects. These effects may be regarded as conditioned responses.

Tobacco dependence has also dramatically impacted Asian countries and subsequently Asian Americans who migrated to the United States. Korean male immigrants in the US have been known for the highest smoking prevalence and highest smoking-attributable cancer death fractions. The study is designed to test the applicability of Theory of Planned Behavior to Korean Americans&#x02019; smoking cessation. Its main hypothesis is that perceived risks and benefits of quitting, social norms for quitting, self-efficacy in smoking cessation, and nicotine dependence will predict behavioral intentions to quit smoking among Korean American smokers. A nationwide sample of Korean American smokers is currently recruited into this one-time telephone survey. Subjects are randomly selected from the online website InfoSpace.com by their Korean surname such as &#x0201c;Kim&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Lee&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Choi&#x0201d;, etc. The sample size of each city was weighted by the Korean population in the 2000 U.S. Census data. Three cities such as Duluth, GA that lately have the large influx of Korean Americans were added to the list of cities. Preliminary findings with 181 subjects (150 males and 31 females) revealed that gender moderates the relationships between perceived risks of quitting and behavioral intentions to quit smoking in Korean American smokers. Perceived family social norm for quitting was the only significant factor associated with Korean male smokers&#x02019; behavioral intentions to quit smoking, whereas, perceived risks of quitting, and perceived family and friend social norms for quitting were the factors associated with Korean female smokers&#x02019; behavioral intentions to quit smoking. However, perceived risks of quitting showed the strongest relationship. Data collection will be continued till May 31, 2010 and final results will be presented.</p><p id="__p4400">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sun Kim, PhD, Psychiatry, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, 01652; sun.kim@umassmed.edu</p><p id="__p4401">\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583828756784" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figan_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figan_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figan_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583828756784" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p4402">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Mairtin McDermott, MSc, BSc, Health Psychology Section, King&#x02019;s Colege London, Institute of Psychiatry, London, SE1 9RT; mairtin.mcdermott@kcl.ac.uk</p><p id="__p4403">OS29</p><p id="__p4404">10:30&#x000a0;AM-10:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4405">OS29-A</p><p id="__p4406">INCREASING RATES OF ORGAN DONATION - THE ROLE OF THE &#x0201c;ICK FACTOR&#x0201d; AND ANTICIPATED REGRET</p><p id="__p4407">Ronan O&#x02019;Carroll, PhD, Catherine Foster, BSc, Grant McGeechan, MSc and Kayleigh Sandford, BSc</p><p id="__p4408">University of Stirling, Stirling, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p4409">Background: There are over 100,000 people in the USA and 10,000 in the UK awaiting organ transplants. Over 90% of the general population state that they are in favour of organ donation, however only 26% of the UK population are registered on the organ donor register. There is an urgent need to identify barriers, and find ways of increasing the number of organ donors.</p><p id="__p4410">Objectives: This research tested the role of emotional barriers to organ donation such as the &#x0201c;ick factor&#x0201d; (a basic disgust reaction to the idea of organ donation). In addition we tested the potential role of manipulating anticipated regret to increase intention to donate in people who are not yet registered as organ donors</p><p id="__p4411">Methods: In 3 Experiments involving 635 members of the UK general public, participants were invited to complete questionnaire measures tapping the emotional factors such as &#x0201c;ick&#x0201d;, the desire to retain body integrity after death and medical mistrust. Registered organ donors were compared with non-donors. Non-donors were randomly allocated to an anticipated regret manipulation (2 questions) versus a control condition, and the impact on intention to donate was tested.</p><p id="__p4412">Results: In all 3 experiments non-donors scored significantly higher than donors on the ick factor and bodily integrity scales. Traditional rational/cognitive factors such as knowledge, attitude and subjective norm failed to distinguish doors from non-donors. For non-donors, the anticipated regret manipulation led to a significant increase in intention to register as an organ donor in future.</p><p id="__p4413">Conclusions: Negative emotional factors are important barriers for people becoming organ donors. In particular a basic disgust reaction when contemplating donation and the desire to retain bodily integrity after death are key areas to target to test if they are changeable.

In particular, Malays (20.7%) indicate lower willingness to donate organs compared to the Chinese (36.6%) and Indians (51.4%) (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, willingness to donate one&#x02019;s own organ was associated with knowledge score (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.13-1.22), attitude score (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.05-1.31), secondary school education (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.46, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.05-2.02) and Malay ethnicity (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.18, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03-0.94).

Method: The integration of Sufficiency Economy(SE), Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions(ICCC) and Community-Based Participation Research(CPBR) was employed to five communities of Pamok district, Angthong province. Five stake-holders(diabetes patients, diabetes risk group, health care volunteers, health officers, and local administrators) were invited to participate in this study. The process in each community consisted of focus group discussion using Appreciation Influence Control(AIC), semi-formal interview, and informal interview. Results: The similarity of diabetes problem situations in each stake-holder were; less knowledge or no awareness on diabetes, unhealthy food consumption, lack of exercise, and non-adherence treatment. The likeness vision of diabetes in each community were; self care management, empowerment health volunteer, health promotion activities exercise, local wisdom of herb and alternative medicine, and integrate all stake-holder together.

The different perceptions on risks and their relevant factors among stakeholders make it difficult to implement effective risk communication.</p><p id="__p4445">This study aims at developing a model on risk communication for preventing and controlling diabetes mellitus. A six-month study was conducted in March to September 2008. Literature reviewing from both national and international articles provided a conceptual framework and a process for developing risk communication model which was preparing, assessing and working with the community. Stakeholders were approached to involve in all steps of the study. The setting of the study was in Mugdhaharn Province, Thailand.</p><p id="__p4446">The conceptual framework of the risk communication was developed from literature review comprising two major components: 1) risk assessment and 2) risk management. In relation to risk assessment, qualitative and quantitative techniques were applied. The target groups of risk assessment were people at risk of diabetes mellitus, family members, and related persons. The issues to be assessed covered risk factors, risk perception, strengths and weaknesses of self care and risk contexts. The results of the risk assessment led to the guidelines and strategies for coping with the risk factors. Regarding the risk management, the guideline and strategies were initially implemented by focusing on the engagement of the stakeholders which resulted in learning and better understanding among related people. The proposed model reflecting two significant components and its process was accepted by stakeholders and further implemented by local health care team in the study area.</p><p id="__p4447">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Kaysorn Sumpowthong, PhD, Faculty of Public Health, Thammasat University, Patumtani, 10210; kaysorns@tu.ac.th</p><p id="__p4448">\n<strong>Friday</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4449">\n<strong>August 6, 2010</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4450">\n<strong>SYMPOSIA SESSIONS</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4451">\n<strong>2:30&#x000a0;PM-4:00&#x000a0;PM</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4452">SS20</p><p id="__p4453">EVALUATION OF HIV PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS WITH ADOLESCENTS</p><p id="__p4454">Jose P.

Contemporary prevention programs focus on social refusal skills training along with training in more generic "life skills" using cognitive, behavioral, and affective skills training techniques. This type of programming teaches principles of cognitive reframing, behavioral self-control, coping, and relaxation skills, along with how to apply these skills outside of the classroom in high risk situations. This presentation will review the concepts and empirical findings from the "Life Skills Training" prevention program, including short and long-term effects on related risk behaviors. Life Skills Training (LST) is a theoretically-driven evidence-based drug abuse prevention program for middle school students that emphasizes social resistance skills as well as more generic skills such as communication, assertiveness, decision-making, goal-setting, self-control, and coping skills. Over 30 peer-reviewed articles with analyses of 18 separate cohorts of students have demonstrated that the LST program is effective with a variety of populations, producing behavioral effects on alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug use, as well as aggression and delinquency. Because LST targets etiologic factors common to both drug abuse and HIV risk and teaches skills that have a broad application, we examined the extent to which the intervention may reduce later HIV risk behavior. This presentation reviews findings demonstrating that the intervention reduced drug use and HIV risk behaviors in a sample of 2,042 predominantly white, suburban young adults who had received the preventive intervention in junior high school. Additional findings from a sample of 2,122 predominantly minority young adults will be presented demonstrating that several key skills measures (e.g., cognitive and behavioral self-control skills) that are targeted by the intervention predict various forms of substance use and HIV risk behavior in a similar fashion. These findings are presented in order to frame a discussion on the opportunities for developing competence-enhancement prevention programs to address both substance use and HIV risk behaviors, along with the challenges associated with addressing multiple risk behaviors in a single intervention. One goal of the presentation is to suggest that broad-based competence enhancement prevention programs may be an efficient and effective way to prevent a variety of negative outcomes during adolescence.</p><p id="__p4467">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jose P.

Research we recently conducted revealed that two factors may be predictive for the duration to full return to work (RTW). These factors are early partial RTW and work related self-efficacy. This conclusion is based on three individual focused intervention studies that have been conducted in recent years. The first study was a randomized controlled study with two experimental interventions and one no treatment condition. One hundred self-employed were randomly assigned to one of the conditions. Psychological complaints, professional efficacy and other variables were assessed before, after 4&#x000a0;months and after 10&#x000a0;months. Partial and full RTW was assessed continuously. The second study was a cluster randomized comparative intervention study with an experimental condition and a care as usual condition. One hundred sixty eight employees absent form work due to psychological complaints enrolled in the study. Psychological complaints, work related self-efficacy and other variables were assessed at three times, before, after 6&#x000a0;months and after 12&#x000a0;months. Partial and full RTW were assessed continuously. The third study was a longitudinal cohort study with 177 employees absent form work due to psychological complaints. Partial and full RTW were assessed continuously. Further, psychological complaints, work related self-efficacy and other variables were assessed at a three months time interval during one year.</p><p id="__p4505">Both partial and work related self-efficacy appeared to be strong predictors of full RTW. This result fits the theoretical notion of graded activity as part of an individual focused treatment and the concept of self-efficacy as a moderating or facilitating factor in restoring an individual&#x02019;s work capacity after sick leave due to work related psychological complaints.</p><p id="__p4506">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Roland Blonk, PhD, TNO Quality of Life, Hoofddorp, 2130 AS; roland.blonk@tno.nl</p><p id="__p4507">SS22</p><p id="__p4508">HOW DIFFERENT OR SIMILAR ARE ETHNIC/RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE US AND UK?</p><p id="__p4509">Yvonne Kelly, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Amanda Sacker, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Pamela Davis-Kean, PhD,<sup>4</sup> Sharon Simonton, PhD,<sup>4</sup> James Nazroo, PhD,<sup>3</sup> Laia Becares, PhD<sup>1</sup> and Samantha Worzalla, MSc<sup>4</sup>\n</p><p id="__p4510"><sup>1</sup>Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom; <sup>2</sup>University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom; <sup>3</sup>University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom and <sup>4</sup>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.</p><p id="__p4511">Ethnic/racial disparities in early childhood health and development are evident in the US and UK.

We examine evidence for ethnic disparities in children&#x02019;s height at 3 and 5&#x000a0;years. Data are from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, constructed to over-represent children from ethnic minority, giving us reasonable sample sizes for Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African and Black Caribbean groups. Mean birth weight of ethnic minority children was significantly lower than that of the ethnic majority (range 3.06 - 3.34&#x000a0;kg versus 3.41&#x000a0;kg). By contrast, ethnic minority children were taller than the White majority at ages 3 and 5, significantly so in the case of Pakistani, Black Caribbean and Black African children (by 0.5&#x000a0;cm, 1.4&#x000a0;cm. and 3.5&#x000a0;cm at 5&#x000a0;years). Controlling for parental height to take account of intergenerational effects did not affect height differentials. Two mechanisms were hypothesised: (a) a poorer intrauterine environment given the short stature of some minority children&#x02019;s mothers resulted in catch-up postnatal growth and (b) conditions during the parents&#x02019; childhood led to a reduced capacity to reach their own height potential. A reparameterization of parent heights showed that mother&#x02019;s height contributed more to predicting child height than mean parental height. Adding birth weight to the model showed that height was positively related to birth weight and attenuated the extra contribution from mothers&#x02019; heights to non significance. The interaction of mean parental height with ethnicity was significant in models at age 3 and age 5. For all ethnic minority groups, mean parental height was more weakly related to child height than in White majority families, although only significantly different in the largest Pakistani group. In conclusion, we found evidence of catch-up growth in ethnic minority children and that ethnic minority parents had not reached their height potential. There was no suggestion that the lower birth weight of ethnic minority children has adverse consequences for their growth in the pre-school years.</p><p id="__p4520">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Yvonne Kelly, PhD, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, E11 1BZ; y.kelly@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="__p4521">SS22b</p><p id="__p4522">IS EXPERIENCE OF RACISM RELATED TO EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT IN THE UK?</p><p id="__p4523">Yvonne Kelly, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Laia Becares, PhD<sup>1</sup> and James Nazroo, PhD<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p4524"><sup>1</sup>Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom and <sup>2</sup>School of Social Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p4525">Background: Previous work has shown that experience of racism is related to poor health outcomes in adults, but little is known about whether such experiences translate into developmental outcomes in children.</p><p id="__p4526">Objectives: 1. to examine the relationship between parental experience of racism and markers of child development 2. to assess whether family socioeconomic position and neighbourhood level disadvantage explain observed relationships.</p><p id="__p4527">Methods: Data from the UK Millennium cohort study on ethnic minority participants of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and African descent were used (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;2157).

These early skills may be important for indicating brain development that may be promoting later motor development and problem solving.</p><p id="__p4546">In order to examine our model we use the first wave (9&#x000a0;months old) of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), which is a nationally representative sample of children born in the US in 2001. For the analyses, 10, 680 children were examined. We controlled for child&#x02019;s age, being foreign born, multiple births, low birth weight, highest parental education in the home, and household income. We examined whether children were breastfeed as a parental nutrition indicator, and age child pulled themselves to standing, age of walking with help as child as indicators of early motor skills/early brain development.</p><p id="__p4547">Using hierarchical regressions we find that low birth weight, age of pulling oneself to a standing position and walking with help are negative predictors of early gross motor skills (B&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.07,&#x02212;.07, &#x02212;.02 respectively). Being Black, is a positive predictor of gross motor skills (.03). These variables with controls account for 70% of the variance in gross motor skills. For early mental skills, being Black and household income is associated with a .02 positive increase and age walking with help (.06) was also positive. Being Asian (-02), low birth weight (-.04), and ever breastfeed (-.02), are negative predictors. Similar levels of variance are accounted for (.70) with children&#x02019;s age being the largest predictor of both gross motor and mental skills (.82, .84, respectively).</p><p id="__p4548">Though the effects are small, there is some indication that early motor and mental skills may be related to early breastfeeding and physical motor skills.</p><p id="__p4549">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Yvonne Kelly, PhD, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, E11 1BZ; y.kelly@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="__p4550">\n<strong>Friday</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4551">\n<strong>August 6, 2010</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4552">\n<strong>PAPER SESSIONS</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4553">\n<strong>2:30&#x000a0;PM-4:00&#x000a0;PM</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4554">OS30</p><p id="__p4555">2:30&#x000a0;PM-2:48&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p4556">OS30-A</p><p id="__p4557">NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND HEALTHFUL LIFESTYLES IN OLDER ADULTS: RESULTS FROM THE SENIORS NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY OF LIFE STUDY</p><p id="__p4558">Abby King, PhD,<sup>1</sup> James Sallis, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Lawrence Frank, PhD,<sup>3</sup> Brian Saelens, PhD,<sup>4</sup> David Ahn, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Terry Conway, PhD<sup>2</sup> and Kelli Cain, MS<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p4559"><sup>1</sup>Stanford University School of Medicine, Los Altos, CA; <sup>2</sup>SDSU, San Diego, CA; <sup>3</sup>UrbanDesign4Health, Inc, Atlanta, GA and <sup>4</sup>Seattle Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Seattle, WA.</p><p id="__p4560">Automobile-oriented urban design is linked with increasingly sedentary lifestyles, which are associated with an array of chronic diseases as people age. Yet little work has occurred on the relationships among built environment features and active transport and other physical activity (PA) forms among older adults. 709 adults ages 66&#x000a0;yrs and above living in Seattle or Baltimore regions were recruited from GIS-enumerated neighborhoods identified as high or low affluent and high or low &#x02018;walkable&#x02019; based on land use mix, street connectivity, and other features. Variables included reported active transport (walking/bicycling for errands), general PA (via accelerometry and self-report), and reported BMI and mobility impairments. Persons in less affluent neighborhoods reported generally less PA and higher BMI. After controlling for individual and neighborhood-level sociodemographic and regional factors, walkability was positively associated with active transport (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001), total PA (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.036), leisure walking/cycling/jogging (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.008), accelerometry-derived minutes/day of moderate or vigorous PA (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.056), and lower BMI (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02). A significant walkability-mobility impairment interaction was observed for active transport only; as mobility increased, differences in minutes/week of active transport among those living in low vs. high walkable neighborhoods increased (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001). Persons in the lowest mobility tertile living in high walkable neighborhoods had active transport levels comparable to persons in the two higher mobility tertiles but living in less walkable neighborhoods (means&#x02009;=&#x02009;35&#x000a0;mins/wk vs. 27&#x000a0;mins/wk, respectively, p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.13).

The large sample size (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5890 trips) allowed stratified analysis by age group (5-10, 11-15, 16-18) and distance to school (0-1.5 miles, 1.5-3 miles, over 3 miles), while controlling for sociodemographic factors known to influence travel.</p><p id="__p4569">Results: Using a nested logit model of travel mode choice, we observed more sidewalks, higher residential densities and interconnected street networks along the route to school and higher parental perception of neighborhood school quality were positive, significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;=&#x02009;.05) predictors of higher probabilities of walking to school for shorter distances (0-1.5 miles) and younger children (ages 5-10). Further analysis indicates small marginal changes can substantially improve probabilities of selecting walking - the probability of walking after the increase in sidewalk coverage to 60th percentile is 118.44% of the probability of walking at median sidewalk coverage. However, it also appeared that the influence of urban form can be overwhelmed if other factors (parental perceptions of school quality, traffic safety and crime, or even other urban form characteristics) are not supportive. Land use mix, a consistently significant predictor of adult travel behavior, was consistently not associated with youth school trips.</p><p id="__p4570">Discussion: Travel mode may be predetermined by parents or constrained by other circumstances, and it may only be under certain circumstances - youth located in communities safe from crime and traffic that are close to school - where urban form may influence travel mode.

Despite the known benefits of MPA, over 60% of older adults do not engage in it (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006). Exploring the effective way to keep older adults engaging in MPA is quite important to improve or maintain their health. This study examined what factors could be associated with engaging in MPA for Japanese elderly people.</p><p id="__p4587">Methods: Participants were 180 community-dwelling Japanese elderly people (men&#x02009;=&#x02009;93, women&#x02009;=&#x02009;87: mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;74.67&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.66). We conducted individual interview for each participant to ask the questions, including demographic factors, previous falling history within a year, falls self-efficacy, current physical activity level (Japanese version of International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Version [IPAQ-SV] ; Murase et al., 2002). We divided participants into two groups (MPA group and non-MPA group) on the basis of the result of IPAQ-SV. To reveal the differences between groups, we conducted statistical analyses including t-test, chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis was conducted using PASW Statistics 17.0.</p><p id="__p4588">Results: Compared to non-MPA group, participants in MPA group didn&#x02019;t have chronic pain (&#x003c7;2&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.87, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) or activity restriction (&#x003c7;2&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.93, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01), and didn&#x02019;t experience falls within a year (&#x003c7;2&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.64, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05).

Two independent raters identified common themes and three additional independent raters reviewed the themes for overlapping content and modified the themes listed until they had consensus among them on 32 themes that described the experience of globalization. The Impact of Globalization Scale (IGS) was created with each theme identified as an item. Respondents (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;542; Females&#x02009;=&#x02009;437; Mean Age&#x02009;=&#x02009;19&#x000a0;years; 47.4% Christian &#x00026; 36.3% Hindu) from the same institute stated the frequency with which each of the themes identified were a source of stress to them on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from &#x0201c;almost never&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;almost always&#x0201d;. Exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation identified the presence of 4 factors. Based on an examination of item content the factors were named: Egalitarian Values, which described a healthy challenge to traditional norms/roles (Eigenvalue(e) = 16.21; % Variance Accounted For (%) = 50.66; Internal Reliability Alpha (A) = .97); Unhealthy Habits or an increase in alcohol/smoking, etc (e&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.53; % =7.90; r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.83); Challenging Traditions or declining traditional value (e&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.18; % =3.69; A&#x02009;=&#x02009;.76); and Growth of Competitiveness &#x00026; Materialism (e&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.07; % = 3.33; A&#x02009;=&#x02009;.36). Correlations of these factors with measures of anger, anxiety, rumination, symptom report (SR), and stress revealed that Egalitarian values was positively associated with SR (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.12, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.008); Unhealthy habits correlated with SR (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.17, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), anger (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.11, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), rumination (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.11, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01); Challenging Traditions correlated with SR (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.16, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), anger (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.10, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.03), rumination (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.13, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.003); Competitiveness correlated with SR (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.14, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.003), stress (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.10, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.02), anxiety (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.10, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.02), rumination (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.10, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.03).

Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Barthel index (BI) were used to assess mental state and functional status, respectively. The stroke survivors completed a questionnaire measuring Buddhist values, Buddhist practices, and Thai Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

Changes in the natural and physical environment i.e. climate variability, physiography and population growth; the socioeconomic environment affecting health-seeking behaviour and noncompliance with medication; a lack of healthcare facilities and poor professional attitudes; and ineffective law enforcement on medicine dispensing, manufacturing and disposal were viewed as possible contributors to resistance development.</p><p id="__p4624">Conclusion and implication: Our study indicates that although behavioural and social environmental factors are major contributors to resistance development, changes in the physical and natural environment exacerbate these problems, and suggests further quantitative studies. The study also indicates a lack of information about and awareness of what constitutes prudent use of antibiotics and thus emphasizes the need for comprehensive action including information, education, dissemination and proper implementation and enforcement of legislation at all levels of drug delivery and disposal in order to rationalize antibiotic use.</p><p id="__p4625">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Krushna C.

This questionnaire developed in 2000 by the National Institute of Occupational Health in Copenhagen, is considered one of the most powerful tools in the evaluation of important psychosocial dimensions, such as cognitive skills and emotional rewards, interpersonal conflict, stress and harassment stemming from occupation. The questionnaire seems to be comprehensive and to include most of the relevant dimensions according to several important theories on psychosocial factors at work. Is presented in three different lengths for assessing psychosocial factors at work, stress, and the well-being of employees and some personality factors. The purpose of the COPSOQ concept is to improve and facilitate research, as well as practical interventions at workplaces.</p><p id="__p4632">The Portuguese COPSOQ validation study is conduct by a project group headed by de Foundation of Science and Technology (FCT).

Little attention has been directed toward the impact of rewarding social roles on physical health.</p><p id="__p4644">Methods: To examine the link between rewarding social roles and progression of coronary calcification (CAC) among women at midlife, psychosocial assessments and CT scans were compared as part of the Study of Women&#x02019;s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Heart ancillary study conducted from 2001-2005 in Chicago, IL and Pittsburgh, PA. Data from 337 women (31% black, 69% white; mean age, 50.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.8) years) with 2 assessments an average of 2.3&#x000a0;years apart were analyzed. Four roles - spouse, parent, employee, and caregiver - were assessed and rated on a 5-point scale from not rewarding to extremely rewarding. CAC was assessed via electron beam computed tomography; progression was defined as an increase in CAC of &#x0003e;10 Agatston units and analyzed using relative risk (RR) regression.</p><p id="__p4645">Results: White women had more roles than black women (mean 2.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7 vs. 2.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045) and found their roles more rewarding (mean 3.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7 vs. 3.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007). In a multivariable model adjusted for baseline calcium, age, time between CT scans, race, education, BMI, blood pressure, statin use, smoking, menopausal status, HT use, and HDL cholesterol, rewarding social roles significantly predicted CAC progression. Each 1-point higher reward score was associated with decreased risk [RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.66 (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.47-0.93), p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.018].

In Colombia, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Individuals with chronic diseases have poorer-quality of life (QOL), however, little is known about the QOL of Colombians with CHD or QOL evolution over time. The SF-36, a self-report instrument validated in Spanish with 8 sub-scales, was used to measure QOL in 19 CHD patients from the Cl&#x000ed;nica Cardiovascular in Medell&#x000ed;n, Colombia and 33 controls at baseline and 6-month follow-up. The CHD Patients were significantly older than the Controls (61.9&#x000a0;yrs vs 55.0&#x000a0;yrs, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and more likely to be male (84% vs 18%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Individual 2 (group: patient vs control) x 2 (time: baseline vs 6&#x000a0;months) ANCOVAs were conducted for each QOL sub-scale, controlling for age and gender. Results indicated a main effect for group on 4 sub-scales, such that, compared to Controls, CHD Patients had significantly lower Physical Role Limitation (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), Vitality (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), Mental Health (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), and Pain (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) scores across both time points. For the Physical Functioning and Emotional Role Limitations sub-scales, there was a main effect for group (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and a group X time interaction (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) such that CHD Patients had lower scores than Controls, but significantly increased their scores from baseline to follow-up, while the Controls stayed the same. For the Social Functioning and General Health sub-scales, there were marginally significant differences for group such that CHD Patients tended to have lower scores than Controls across both time points. CHD patients in Medell&#x000ed;n report having poorer QOL across all SF-36 domains, improving in 2 areas. These findings suggest the need for psychologists, nurses, and other health professionals to develop and implement culturally-appropriate interventions to improve QOL in Colombian patients with CHD.</p><p id="__p4655">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Heather Rogers, PhD, MPH, Department of Social and Behavioral Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, 23233; hlrogers@vcu.edu</p><p id="__p4656">3:24&#x000a0;PM-3:42&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p4657">OS32-D</p><p id="__p4658">COGNITIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF HEART FAILURE AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS WITH TREATMENT ADHERENCE</p><p id="__p4659">Lana A.

Preliminary research suggests that misconceptions about HF and its treatment may underlie difficulties in self-management. However HF patients are an understudied population and little is known about their illness and treatment beliefs. Guided by the Common-Sense Model, we examined the illness and treatment representations of HF patients, and their relationships with adherence. HF patients (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;79) completed a questionnaire assessing illness beliefs (IPQ-R), treatment beliefs (TRI), and adherence to medications and lifestyle behaviours. Descriptive analyses showed general uncertainty or low awareness of HF as a chronic (versus acute or cyclic) condition and uncertainty or doubts regarding potential for control. There was significant misidentification of symptoms, with only 60% of participants correctly identifying 5 or more of the key symptoms (breathlessness, weight change, fatigue, wheeziness, sleep difficulties, loss of strength, swelling). Regression analyses, controlling for demographic factors, identified several illness and treatment beliefs as predictors of adherence. Stronger beliefs in a chronic timeline predicted greater dietary adherence (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.31, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001). Greater adherence to lifestyle changes was predicted by lower levels of cyclical timeline beliefs (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;3.74, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.000). Higher beliefs in the treatment&#x02019;s value predicted better medication adherence (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;2.72, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.008). Illness and treatment beliefs may play an important role in promoting treatment adherence and healthy lifestyle practices in individuals with HF. Many HF patients appear to lack a comprehensive understanding of their condition and its treatment, resulting in vague representations and potentially contributing to poor treatment adherence. Improving understanding of HF may strengthen representations, leading to improvements in adherence.</p><p id="__p4662">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lana A.

However, non-adherence is not only caused by memory dysfunction, as adherence is a complex behavioural regimen including planning, forming intentions and implementing actions. Neurocognitive executive functioning is a precondition for these action-plans and therefore serves as a base for adherence. Based on a model of executive function in medical illnesses this study investigates the link between executive function and adherence to medication in heart failure patients.</p><p id="__p4669">Method: Executive function in patients (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;130) with heart failure is tested using Trail-Making test, Go/noGo-, Visual Set-Shifting- and n-Back task; other neurocognitive tests include digit-span (forward/backward), word recall (short/long-term), alertness and focussed attention. Self-reported adherence is assessed using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale adjusted for social desirability. As possible confounders age, years of education, beliefs about medicines, illness perception, and depression are analyzed. To define health status quality of life, NYHA-class and relevant biological health markers are measured.</p><p id="__p4670">Results: Preliminary results indicate that non-adherent patients showed worse performance on Trail-Making test and n-Back task (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05).

In a prospective study, 155 individuals with whiplash were assessed at &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;month, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post injury. Outcomes at each time point were: Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Group based trajectory analytical techniques were used to identify outcome profiles. The analyses were then repeated after including third party compensation claim lodgment as a binary time-changing covariate. Three distinct NDI trajectories were determined: 1) Mild: mild or negligible pain/disability for the entire 12&#x000a0;months (45%), 2) Moderate: initial moderate pain/disability that decreased to mild levels by 3&#x000a0;months (39%) and 3) Chronic-severe: severe pain/disability persisting at moderate/severe levels for 12&#x000a0;months (16%). Three distinct PTSD trajectories were also identified: 1) Resilient: mild symptoms throughout (40%), 2) Recovering: initial moderate symptoms declining to mild levels by 3&#x000a0;months (43%) and 3) Chronic moderate-severe: persistent moderate/severe symptoms throughout 12&#x000a0;months (17%).

Following whiplash injury, there are distinct pathways of recovery for pain/ disability and PTSD symptoms. Management of whiplash should consider the detrimental effect of compensation claim on psychological recovery and those with mild to moderate pain/disability levels.

More than hostility (a known psychological risk indicator for heart disease), rebelliousness might be strongly related to health and heart disease via rebellious persons opposing and obstructing health campaigns aimed at modifying unhealthy behaviours. We set out to examine, firstly, the psychometric properties of a rebelliousness questionnaire and, secondly, the extent to which rebelliousness and hostility compete in the prediction of incident heart disease and in the contribution to socioeconomic differences in health. Using Dutch data on older men and women (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,485), we found moderate reliability (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; ranging between 0.50 and 0.60) and moderate (construct) validity, as indicated by rebelliousness being (moderately) associated with low control beliefs, hostility, and unhealthy behaviours. Using longitudinal data (n&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2,000), we will further report on the extent to which rebelliousness is more common (than hostility) in lower socioeconomic status groups, the extent to which rebelliousness is more common (than hostility) in the etiology of heart disease, and the extent to which rebelliousness more strongly (than hostility) affects heart disease through poor health behaviours. The findings add to the body of evidence on the psychological pathways involved in how socioeconomic structure gets under the skin.</p><p id="__p4718">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hans Bosma, PhD, Social Medicine, CAPHRI, Maastricht, 6200 MD; hans.bosma@socmed.unimaas.nl</p><p id="__p4719">2:48&#x000a0;PM-3:06&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p4720">OS34-B</p><p id="__p4721">OBJECTIVELY ASSESSED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH AMONG ELDERLY: THE IMCA-ACTIFE STUDY</p><p id="__p4722">Richard Peter, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Jochen Klenk, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Sebastian Franke, Psychologist,<sup>1</sup> Michael Denkinger, MD,<sup>2</sup> Kilian Rapp, MD,<sup>3</sup> Gudrun Weinmayr, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Thorsten Nikolaus, MD<sup>2</sup> and IMCA ActiFe Study Group, MD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p4723"><sup>1</sup>Epidemiology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Bethesda Hospital, Ulm, Germany and <sup>3</sup>Robert-Bosch Hospital, Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p id="__p4724">Physical activity is a powerful predictor of health in older ages.

The present investigation applies an ambulatory objective measurement of physical activity which helps to avoid bias.</p><p id="__p4725">The baseline screening of a prospective study is currently conducted in a random sample of the older population in the greater Ulm area, Germany. It is planned to investigate 1500 men and women aged 65 to 90&#x000a0;years. Recently, about 1000 are included. Extensive information on cognitive and physical functioning, chronic disease, quality of life and socio-demographic variables is derived from well-tested questionnaires and tests. Information on medication and falls is assessed prospectively. Lung function is measured according to international standards. Blood samples are taken to determine biomarkers. Furthermore, physical activity is assessed ambulatory with the help of accelerometers.The accelerometer information is combined with an activity diary.</p><p id="__p4726">First preliminary results show associations between physical activity as measured by the accelerometers and health. Individuals with type II diabetes are significantly less active as compared to elderly without this disease even after adjustment for age and gender. Over a period of at least 5&#x000a0;days subjects with diabetes are on an average one hour per day longer inactive as compared to the healthy group. Further analyses will include a number of additional variables presumably influencing these associations like depression, lung function, and cognitive as well as physical functioning.</p><p id="__p4727">First preliminary results of the IMCA-ActiFe study indicate the validity of objective measurement of physical activity and show associations of inactivity with type II diabetes.

Approximately 10.4 million family caregivers of people with Alzheimer&#x02019;s and other dementias provide care to their loved ones in the community. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between highly resourceful and less resourceful family caregivers on role reward, preparedness for caregiving, anxiety and depression.</p><p id="__p4735">Method: A comparative descriptive design was used on baseline data of 84 family caregivers who were living with and caring for person diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.

Depression was measured with the 20-item CESD scale. Preparedness was measured using the 8-item Family Preparedness Scale (Archbold &#x00026; Stewart, 1994). Anxiety was measured using the Anxiety Scale on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Speilberger et al, 1970).

Even sixty years after the WW II, this cohort is significantly more often affected by posttraumatic symptomatology compared to the younger cohorts (Maercker et al., 2008). The present study is addressing prevalence rates of posttraumatic symptomatology and it&#x02019;s comorbidity with depression and somatization. Methods: The study examines PTSD according to DSM-IV, partial PTSD, depression and somatisation in a randomly selected sample of the German general population aged 60 to 85&#x000a0;years (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.659) using self rating instruments (PHQ, PDS). Results: One-month prevalence rates were 2.8% for DSM-IV PTSD, another 11.9% fulfilled the criteria of partial PTSD. This points out, that sub threshold symptomatology plays a major role in the elderly. 11.5% of the persons affected by PTSD symptomatology fulfil the criteria of a somatoform syndrome, 8.5% fulfil the criteria of Major Depression and 10.4% fulfil the criteria of other depressive syndromes according the Patient Health Questionnaire. 5.6% report both - depression and somatoform disorder. Discussion: Even sixty years after WW II, posttraumatic symptomatology is more common in the elderly in Germany compared to the younger cohorts. It is often accompanied by other comorbid mental disorders like depression or somatisation. Implications of these findings for health and health care in the elderly will be discussed.</p><p id="__p4746">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Heide Glaesmer, Dr, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, 04103; Heide.Glaesmer@medizin.uni-leipzig.de</p><p id="__p4747">OS35</p><p id="__p4748">2:30&#x000a0;PM-2:48&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p4749">OS35-A</p><p id="__p4750">&#x0201c;WE ARE SURVIVORS TOO&#x0201d;: AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS&#x02019; EXPERIENCES OF COPING WITH PARENTAL BREAST CANCER</p><p id="__p4751">Karni Kissil, MA, M Ed, Alba Nino, MS in Marriage and Family Therapy, Maureen Davey, PhD and Carolyn Y.

Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using content analysis.</p><p id="__p4755">Results: African American youth described fear and uncertainty about the mortality of their parent, their unpredictable future, and discomfort in negotiating breast cancer&#x02019;s relationship with the entire family.

Adolescents need more developmentally appropriate preparation for the family changes likely to occur when a parent is diagnosed and treated for breast cancer.

Socio-demographic-, and clinical variables and data on comorbidity were obtained from the surgical departments and national longitudinal registries.</p><p id="__p4766">Results: Overall CAM use was associated with more depressive symptoms at follow-up.

Worsening glucose metabolism appears to contribute to patient&#x02019;s level of distress and may be an important factor in explaining future prognosis. We examined associations between psychological distress, glucose metabolism and death in adults with and without diabetes. In a representative, prospective study of 18,525 adults (4.1% with physician-diagnosed diabetes) we measured levels of psychological distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and blood was collected for the assessment of glycated haemoglobin, a marker of glucose metabolism. The main outcome was all cause death. Psychological distress, that was defined as GHQ-12 score of &#x02265;4, was apparent in 19.5% and 13.9% of participants with and without diabetes, respectively. Distress was associated with greater cardiovascular morbidity although not with impaired glucose metabolism in diabetics. Among diabetics there were 187 deaths over an average of 6.0&#x000a0;years of follow up. Distress was associated with higher risk of death (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.95, 95% CI, 1.34 - 2.84) after adjustment for glucose control, health behaviours, and cardiovascular co-morbidity. The synergistic coexistence of diabetes and distress was associated with an elevated risk of all cause death, beyond that due to having either diabetes or distress alone. In summary, psychological distress is an independent risk factor for death in diabetic patients, but this association was not explained through impaired glucose metabolism. Early screening for distress may have important implications for prevention and treatment in diabetics.</p><p id="__p4809">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Mark Hamer, PhD, Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT; m.hamer@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="__p4810">3:06&#x000a0;PM-3:24&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p4811">OS36-E</p><p id="__p4812">&#x0201c;IT JUST CREPT UP ON ME&#x0201d; UNDERSTANDING THE HEALTH AND WEIGHT EXPERIENCES OF OBESE MEN IN AUSTRALIA: A QUALITATIVE STUDY</p><p id="__p4813">Sophie Lewis, BmedSci,<sup>1</sup> Samantha L.

However, there is only limited understanding of the health beliefs and health behaviours of obese men. This qualitative study of Australian men with obesity (BMI over 30) aimed to explore their beliefs about their weight, health and wellbeing; their attitudes towards weight loss; and the strategies that they employed to lose weight or improve their health.</p><p id="__p4816">Method: In-depth semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a community sample of men with a body mass index of 30 or more. A range of community engagement strategies were used to encourage men to take part in the study from different socioeconomic and geographical backgrounds. Data were analysed using a descriptive thematic approach.</p><p id="__p4817">Results: Thirty-six men participated. Most men stated that they were not aware of their weight gain and that their weight had increased slowly and steadily over a number of years. Often a significant life event, for example a health scare, motivated men to recognise that their weight was a problem and that they needed to lose weight. Men often blamed themselves for their obesity. They believed that their obesity was primarily caused by a lack of activity rather than their eating behaviours. Most strongly believed that it was their personal responsibility to lose weight and felt confident that they could achieve weight loss without the support of family members or health professionals. However, they wanted to be engaged in strategies that focused on improving their health and fitness, rather than weight loss. They felt that this was a more empowering approach and the most effective way to lose weight and keep it off. Perceived barriers to successful weight loss included commitment to work and family; social pressures to maintain unhealthy behaviours; and the costs of interventions such as gym memberships, personal trainers and commercial diets.</p><p id="__p4818">Conclusion: The information provided in this study informs how we can tailor medical and public health strategies for obese men that resonate with their lived experiences. It also highlights the importance of social and contextual factors in understanding the experiences of obese adults.</p><p id="__p4819">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sophie Lewis, BmedSci, School of Primary Health Care, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, 3168; sophie.lewis@med.monash.edu.au</p><p id="__p4820">3:24&#x000a0;PM-3:42&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p4821">OS36-D</p><p id="__p4822">OBESE ADULTS ATTITUDES&#x02019; TOWARDS INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR OBESITY: A QUALITATIVE COMMUNITY STUDY</p><p id="__p4823">Samantha L.

Those that screened positive had a diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) confirmed using the CIDI. Thus 178 patients with MDE were randomly allocated to direct referral to the hospital psychology service, information and a letter for patients to give to their primary care practitioner or usual care. Patients were assessed and then followed up six-months later to assess depression and diabetes outcomes. Patients in both the direct referral and the primary care conditions improved significantly on measures of depression compared to those in the usual care condition. However, only those patients in the primary care condition also improved significantly on a measure of diabetes control, HbA1.</p><p id="__p4837">These findings suggest that screening for depression following by primary care is valuable in the management of diabetes.</p><p id="__p4838">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Justin Kenardy, PhD, CONROD, University of Queensland, Herston, QLD, 4006; j.kenardy@uq.edu.au</p><p id="__p4839">\n<strong>Saturday</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4840">\n<strong>August 7, 2010</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4841">\n<strong>SYMPOSIA SESSIONS</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4842">\n<strong>8:30&#x000a0;AM-10:00&#x000a0;AM</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4843">SS23</p><p id="__p4844">PEER SUPPORT ACROSS CULTURAL, NATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL SETTINGS: COMMON FUNCTIONS AND SETTING-SPECIFIC FEATURES</p><p id="__p4845">Edwin B.

A major challenge to efforts to characterize peer support is, in turn, the extent to which it is culturally contingent, that is, how characteristics of support are dependent on differing cultural, social, and organizational standards, norms or values. What is a sensitive offer of help in one culture may be intrusive in another or too reserved and thereby indicative of disinterest in a third. Additionally, varying attitudes toward health, fate, life and death as well as cultural contingencies surrounding key health behaviors such as diet add complexity to efforts to promote peer support across different countries. To address these challenges, Peers for Progress, a global program to promote peer support in health care, has followed a strategy of &#x0201c;standardization by function, not content.&#x0201d; This identifies key functions of peer support across cultures and settings which, at the same time, allow for considerable flexibility in content of local implementation. Peers for Progress and its grantees have identified as key functions of peer support 1) assistance in daily management, 2) social and emotional support, 3) linkage to clinical care, and 4) ongoing availability of support. This symposium will explore how this approach has been realized in peer support programs in Australia, China, Thailand and Uganda. From Australia, Dr. Oldenburg will describe extension of support groups that Diabetes Australia-Victoria has established for over a decade to improve daily management, social and emotional support, and linkage to clinical care. From Hong Kong, Dr. Chan will describe &#x0201c;Pearl,&#x0201d; a program that integrates peer support within &#x0201c;Jade,&#x0201d; a program to promote algorithm based, systematic clinical care for diabetes in primary care. From Uganda, Dr. Baumann will describe challenges faced and successes of a peer support program in small, severely under-resourced villages. Finally, Dr. Boothroyd will describe how these and the other eleven project of Peers for Progress have increased understanding of important features of the four key functions of peer support, identified important aspects of implementation, and addressed programmatic, cultural and organizational challenges. Across all of these, identification of common functions guides program development that reflects generalized knowledge while allowing for tailoring to the strengths and characteristics of populations, cultures, and settings.</p><p id="__p4848">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Edwin B.

The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Program is the first web-based program incorporating a comprehensive risk engine, care protocols, clinical decision and self management support to improve ambulatory diabetes care. It uses state-of-the-art information technology to facilitate healthcare professionals to create a diabetes registry. The JADE e-portal also incorporates an interactive risk engine which stratifies patients into different risk levels based on clinical and biochemical data measured annually. With this risk stratification, the JADE e-portal recommends a care protocol tailored to these risk levels with decision support triggered by various risk factors.</p><p id="__p4854">On top of &#x02018;High-Tech&#x02019; accessories, quality diabetes care requires informed-decisions of motivated care providers and diabetes patients.

They aim to convey expert information about diabetes and to provide social support to members. Building on this experience over many years, the Australasian Peers for Progress Diabetes Program (PfP-DP) aims to implement and evaluate a peer-led group program to improve daily management, social and emotional support, and linkage to clinical care for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Participants will be recruited from the membership of (1) the National Diabetes Services Scheme, an Australian government initiative for people with diabetes to obtain subsidized consumables, and (2) DA-Vic membership of people with T2DM. The intervention trial involves 12 groups of 8-12 people led by lay peer leader(s), who are receiving training in group facilitation, communication, goal setting and motivational skills. Groups will meet monthly for 12&#x000a0;months, during which time group participants will review difficulties with their diabetes care, successes and achievements. The control (waitlist) arm comprises 12 &#x0201c;virtual&#x0201d; groups of similar composition who do not meet and receive their usual care until after the first 12&#x000a0;months. All study participants, and peer leaders, receive 1-day of basic diabetes self-management education prior to intervention groups commencing. Primary outcome is based on cardiovascular risk score (using the UKPDS equations) at baseline, 12 and 18&#x000a0;month follow up. Secondary outcomes include self-care behaviors, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. The program will also undergo an economic evaluation. The program partnership with an NGO and program delivery by volunteer, lay peer leaders trained to support behavior change in people with T2DM could enhance program transfer to other countries within the Asia Pacific region, where lay workers and community health workers are already integral to delivery of health services.</p><p id="__p4863">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Brian F.

Using a pre- post-intervention design, data were collected on A1C, perceptions of social support, coping, and diabetes self-care behaviors. Outcomes were improved daily self-care behaviors, social and emotional support, A1C values, and linkages with healthcare providers. Peer Champions (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) were patients who attended the Mityana diabetes clinic, could speak and read English, and agreed to contact another patient with diabetes (Partner) at least weekly. Champions received education in diabetes self-care and in providing supportive communication to peer Partners. Peer Partners (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) were patients with diabetes who attended the Mityana Clinic. Champions and Partners met at a community meeting where diabetes self-care education was again provided, and participants were assigned to pairs or triads. Telephones provided were linked to a pre-paid network so that calls were free if they were to another peer or champion, or to a healthcare provider. Participants who completed the intervention (28 females, 13 males) had a mean age of 55&#x000a0;years (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;32 to 74) and a mean duration of diabetes of 6.5&#x000a0;years. A post-intervention meeting was held with 16 Champions and 25 Partners to complete measurements and share experiences. Sixty-six percent of participants reported peer contact at least weekly. There was no change in scores on a 5-item diabetes coping scale, a 14-item barriers scale, physical activity or missing medications. Perceptions of social support from family and friends and a single item rating on &#x0201c;confidence in managing diabetes&#x0201d; significantly decreased (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03, and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02 respectively). There was improvement in eating behaviors (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and 77.8% reported that they contacted the clinic and healthcare providers more often than prior to the intervention. The most striking finding was a reduction (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) in mean A1C from 9.8% to 6.8% (by IFCC standards). Eighty percent of participants indicated that the most helpful aspects of peer support were &#x02018;advice about taking care of diabetes&#x02019; and &#x02018;encouragement to contact the clinic&#x02019;. Participants especially liked using pre-paid telephones to contact healthcare providers and peers and receiving written material about diabetes self-care; however, most would have preferred materials in the local language and 92% reported difficulty reading because of poor eyesight. In conclusion, both providers and peers were actively engaged in a program that resulted in improved glycemic control and linkages with healthcare providers; other results may be explained by the resource-poor setting and unique cultural factors.</p><p id="__p4869">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Linda C.

Observations from these provide opportunity for identifying ways in which generalizable key functions of peer support (assistance in daily management, social and emotional support, linkage to clinical care, and ongoing support) are represented in programs as well as ways in which programs are tailored to local characteristics or strengths. In particular, the experiences of individual projects have led not to major changes in the four key functions but to a) enhanced understanding of several of them, b) recognition of important implementation considerations, and c) attention to challenges in implementation. Enhanced understanding of the important of the functions has included recognition of the importance of attention to medications and adherence in a disease like diabetes, emotional and social support, and assisting individuals in navigating the health care system. Implementation considerations include recognizing varied modes of delivery (face-to-face, individual, group, telephone, etc.), the needs not just of individuals but of their family and caregivers, and the need of support providers for their own ongoing encouragement and support. In implementation, recognition has also grown regarding the importance of integration of understanding of the role of peer support across members of the health care team so that everyone delivers a solid and common message though they may be using different &#x0201c;languages.&#x0201d; Challenges have included the widespreaqd and substantial barriers individuals face in transportation, infrastructure (e.g., electricity), and employment, difficulties in negotiating and establishing organizational partnerships, encouraging among peer supporters a stance of &#x0201c;peerage&#x0201d; rather than teaching, and cultural challenges such as those related to roles of women, roles of patients vis a vis professionals, etc. The four functions of peer support that Peer for Progress has emphasized provide important structure to thinking about peer support across national lines, but, nevertheless, leave much room for attention to the kinds of needs and challenges which successful implementation in individual settings must address.</p><p id="__p4875">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Edwin B.

They responded to a survey in 2000-2002 and/or 2004 and their self-reported sleep disturbances were linked to comprehensive individual-level health registers to assess depression from several sources, i.e. medically certified work disability, use of antidepressant medication, and psychotherapy for depression. During a mean follow-up of 3.3&#x000a0;years, 273 participants were granted long-term work disability due to depression, 1611 had new antidepressant treatment and 74 had new commencements of psychotherapy for depression. Any sleep disturbance at least 5 nights per week increased the risk of incident depression to 1.6-1.7-fold after extensive adjustments for baseline age, sex, socioeconomic status, night/shift work, health behaviors, somatic diagnoses, pain killers, psychological distress, and anxiety. Risk of work disability due to depression was 2.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-4.4] in those with difficulties initiating sleep at least 5 nights per week. Too early awakenings and non-refreshing sleep doubled the risk of work disability and difficulties maintaining sleep increased the risk to 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.0). Also moderate sleep disturbances (2-4 nights/week) were associated with increased risk. The results were essentially replicated with antidepressant medication use and psychotherapy.

Methods: Polysomnographic data were collected at a university-based outpatient clinic for adults and elderly. 19 patients using sleep medications on a daily basis (5-7&#x000a0;days per week) for at least one year were compared with 64 drug-free patients complaining of insomnia and 26 good sleepers. Mean age was 63.8&#x000a0;years (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.0). Outcome measures were polysomnographic sleep parameters (total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, slow-wave sleep), and prevalence estimates of sleep apnoea and PLMD. Results: The chronic hypnotic users spent more time awake and had reduced sleep efficiency compared to good sleepers. The amount of slow-wave sleep was significantly lower among chronic hypnotic users compared to the other two groups. There were no differences between the chronic hypnotic users and drug-free patients complaining of insomnia on any of the other PSG-parameters. The prevalence rate of sleep apnoea (AHI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10) was 42% both among the drug-free patients complaining of insomnia and chronic users of sleep medications, compared to 12% in the good sleepers group. There were no significant group differences in the prevalence of PLMD between the three groups (37%-39%). Conclusions: This study suggests that the sleep of chronic users of sleep medications is no better than that of drug-free patients complaining of insomnia. It is disturbing that 42% of the patients treated pharmacologically for insomnia also suffers from sleep apnoea. We suggest careful sleep assessment as a prerequisite for long-term prescription of sleep medications.</p><p id="__p4913">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Borge Sivertsen, PhD, University of Bergen, Bergen, 5015; borge.sivertsen@psykp.uib.no</p><p id="__p4914">SS25</p><p id="__p4915">COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH IN CARDIOVASCULAR BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE</p><p id="__p4916">Catherine M.

There are several design strategies that can provide critical comparative effectiveness information, but a balanced portfolio of methodologies will be most informative. In CER research, patients are studied within the context of real-world clinical settings. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recently developed national priorities for comparative effectiveness research, and has also established a working definition for CER. The IOM also underscored the importance of identifying infrastructure and resources necessary for sustaining CER research. Importantly, among the national priorities identified, a number of recommendations included behavioral interventions (including but not limited to exercise treatments, social support, family issues in care-giving, dietary interventions, improving the built environment, symptom management, cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and many others) related to cardiovascular and other diseases and conditions. There are many opportunities for cardiovascular behavioral medicine studies to contribute important information in CER. The purpose of this symposium is to highlight examples of some of the early behavioral medicine studies that have been conducted in CER, for the purpose of encouraging advances.</p><p id="__p4919">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Catherine M.

To be maximally effective, therefore, efforts to improve population health need to address health risk behaviors. Poor quality diet and sedentary lifestyle are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancers. Four unhealthy behaviors are especially prevalent. in industrialized cultures: eating a high-fat diet, consuming few fruits and vegetables, extensive television viewing, and low moderate-vigorous physical activity. Public health guidelines advise correcting all of these unhealthy behaviors, but little guidance is available about the best approach. To address that question, we conducted a head-to-head comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial(n&#x02009;=&#x02009;200) of four diet and activity interventions, all of which entailed guideline-recommended behavior change. In each condition, participants modified one diet and one activity behavior, while effects on all four behaviors were evaluated as an aggregated healthy lifestyle score. Results indicated that the conventional intervention practice of increasing physical activity and decreasing fat intake produced the least improvement in overall healthy lifestyle. Conversely, a novel approach suggested by behavioral economic theory (increase fruits/vegetables and decrease recreational screen time) maximized across-the-board healthy lifestyle change. To fulfill its full potential, however, comparative effectiveness research needs to extend beyond determining only what works best for the average patient. In the present study, for example, traditional dieting (decrease fat, increase physical activity) minimized overall healthy lifestyle change for females but maximized it for males, suggesting that gender-tailored guidance might be needed. Comparative effectiveness research holds potential to undergird personalized, evidence-based behavioral medicine. The aim is for intervention decisions to be guided by evidence that conveys what works best for particular types of individuals or communities and in different settings and circumstances.</p><p id="__p4925">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Bonnie Spring, PhD, Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60610; bspring@northwestern.edu</p><p id="__p4926">SS25b</p><p id="__p4927">EXERCISE AND PHARMACOTHERAPY IN DEPRESSION</p><p id="__p4928">James Blumenthal, PhD</p><p id="__p4929">Psychiatry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.</p><p id="__p4930">Depression is a very common and disabling condition.

It emphasizes that a sound mind in a sound body is essential to longevity. Recently there is a growing wave of individuals seeking complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments. However, for most of these treatments there are essential questions that remain to be answered through rigorous scientific study-- whether they work for the diseases or medical conditions for which they are used. Ancient self-care practices such as qigong and tai chi have been used traditionally in the East for complementing chronic disease management. Qigong and tai chi are each forms of traditional Chinese medicine practice that combine breathing, movement and meditation. Decades of behavioral medicine investigations suggest life-style modifications including exercise and relaxation-related activities are beneficial for health. Thus, through behavioral medicine, integrative medicine and CAM can perhaps find the perfect venue for determining the health benefits of these practices.</p><p id="__p4943">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anna Rusiewicz, PhD, War Related Illness and Injury Study Center, Stop 129, Dept of Veterans Affairs NJ Healthcare System, East Orange, NJ, 07018; anna.rusiewicz@va.gov</p><p id="__p4944">SS26a</p><p id="__p4945">TAI CHI TRAINING ON SOMATIC SYMPTOMS AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN OLDER HEART FAILURE PATIENTS</p><p id="__p4946">Laura Redwine, PhD and Paul Mills, MD</p><p id="__p4947">Department of Psychiatry and Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.</p><p id="__p4948">Heart failure (HF) affects millions of individuals and is increasing in prevalence each year as the population ages. Approximately one third of HF patients experience clinical depression symptoms, which are further associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality. However, depression treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) do not decrease morbidity/mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. This is not surprising since recent evidence suggests somatic but not cognitive/affective depressive symptoms have a greater association with cardiovascular-related mortality and events. Somatic symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbances are common among HF patients that may lead to physical inactivity and create a spiraling decline in physical and cardiac function. Indeed, physical inactivity is associated with reduced quality of life and greater morbidity and mortality in HF. Meanwhile, Tai Chi practice is observed to increase vigor, and reduce tension, anger and fatigue. Tai Chi emphasizes a holistic approach, both mind and body. It is a meditative exercise originating from China, and with its moderate intensity and relative ease of performance it is well-suited even for those with significant physical impairments. The present study consists of HF patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29 completers; 43-83&#x000a0;years old; mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;72.9, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.1) that had Tai chi training (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) twice per week for 12&#x000a0;weeks or were in a waitlist control group (n = 10). At baseline and after the 12-week intervention period, patients completed the Beck Depression Index (BDI), subcategorized into somatic (BDI-s) and cognitive (BDI-c) symptoms, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory - Short Form (MFSI-SF). All subjects also were measured pre- and post- intervention period for physical function, in a 6-min walk task. Compared to controls, HF patients in the Tai Chi group had reduced total BDI scores from pre- to post-intervention (F(1, 21) = 4.1, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.055, r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.40) and BDI-s (F(1, 21) = 8.5, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01, r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.55), but not BDI-c (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.50). Those in the Tai Chi group also had reduced MFSI total fatigue (F(1, 18) = 4.2, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.054, r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.43) and increased MFSI vigor (F(1, 18) = 5.3, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.033, r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.48) and greater improvement in distance walked F(1,27) = 6.1, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02 in the 6-min walk task compared to controls. These findings suggest that Tai Chi reduces symptoms of depression, due mainly to changes in somatic symptoms, and increases physical function. Larger studies are needed to replicate our findings, to establish Tai Chi as a viable intervention for reducing somatic symptoms of depression and increasing physical function. Future studies should examine whether HF related morbidity and mortality is affected by practicing Tai Chi.

This talk will focus on Tai Chi studies conducted at the UCLA Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology as a means of demonstrating some of the avenues through which Tai Chi may promote mental health.

We conducted a randomized, controlled 3-arm clinical trial in comparing 12-weeks of Qigong, Progressive Resistance Training (PRT), or usual care in 32 adults with type 2 diabetes. Outcome measures included fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, insulin, C-peptide, BMI, HOMA-IR, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Beck&#x02019;s depression Index (BDI) before, during and at the end of the interventions. We found that body weight increased in the usual care group, but decreased in both Qigong and PRT groups.

In contrast, the PRT group showed a significant reduction in depression scores with an increase in fasting glucose and insulin resistance, which also increased in the usual care group (NS). In this presentation, I will discuss three key themes in conducting comparative efficacy clinical trials: 1) understanding the different schools of Qigong; 2) choosing the best control group for Qigong intervention; and 3) choosing an appropriate patient population with type 2 diabetes for Qigong intervention.

Survey data indicate that herbal therapies and mind-body therapies are most commonly used. One such treatment option is qigong. Several reviews have claimed that qigong has therapeutic effects on blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, these reviews are non-systematic and therefore open to bias. To systematically assess the clinical evidence of qigong for hypertension. Databases were searched up to December 2009. All randomized clinical trials testing qigong in patients with hypertension of any origin and assessing clinically relevant outcomes were considered. Trials using any type of control intervention were included. The selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by at least two reviewers. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Jadad score. 12 RCTs could be included. Seven of these RCTs tested qigong in combination with antihypertensive drugs compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. The meta-analysis of four trials reporting adequate data suggested beneficial effects in favour of qigong (weighted mean difference, systolic blood pressure (mmHg) -12.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -17.12 to -7.00; diastolic blood pressure -8.46, 95% CI -12.55 to -4.37). Qigong alone was compared with waiting list control in 2 RCTs and was found to significantly reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (mmHg) -18.46, 95% CI -23.07 to -13.86). In further three RCTs comparisons made were: qigong combined with antihypertensive drugs versus muscle relaxation combined with antihypertensive drugs; qigong as a sole treatment versus exercise and/or antihypertensive drugs, all reported positive results in at least some of the relevant outcome measures. The methodological quality of the original studies was low. There is some encouraging evidence to suggest that qigong is effective for lowering systolic blood pressure. However, the conclusiveness of these findings is limited. Rigorously designed trials seem warranted to confirm these results.</p><p id="__p4967">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Anna Rusiewicz, PhD, War Related Illness and Injury Study Center, Stop 129, Dept of Veterans Affairs NJ Healthcare System, East Orange, NJ, 07018; anna.rusiewicz@va.gov</p><p id="__p4968">\n<strong>Saturday</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4969">\n<strong>August 7, 2010</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4970">\n<strong>PAPER SESSIONS</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4971">\n<strong>8:30&#x000a0;AM-10:00&#x000a0;AM</strong>\n</p><p id="__p4972">\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583828026736" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figat_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figat_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figat_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583828026736" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p4973">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Hendrik de Heer, PhD MPH, Social and Behavioral Research Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, Silver Spring, MD, 20910; dirk.deheer@nih.gov</p><p id="__p4974">8:48&#x000a0;AM-9:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p4975">OS37-B</p><p id="__p4976">DO PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS MEDIATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MEDICINE USE AND ADOLESCENTS&#x02019; MIGRANT BACKGROUND?</p><p id="__p4977">Lourdes Cantarero-Ar&#x000e9;valo, Economist, MPH, PhD Student,<sup>1,3</sup> Bj&#x000f8;rn E.

Among the girls who took medicine for stomach-ache the odds were 1.27 (0.92-1.73) for descendants and 1.50 (1.09-2.05) for migrants. The psychosocial factor &#x0201c;feeling helpless&#x0201d; modifies the effect by reducing the odds to 1.23 (0.90-1.69) for descendants and 1.48 (1.08-2.04) for first generation migrants.</p><p id="__p4982">Conclusion: There is higher risk of using medicine among non-native populations, and it is statistically significant for stomach-ache medicines.

There is, however, only limited number of studies using UK longitudinal data, and limited number of data using health measures as study outcomes. The aim of this study is to cover these gaps by looking at influence of maternal employment in three periods of childhood on health outcomes among young people aged 16-21&#x000a0;years in British Household Panel Survey (BHPS).</p><p id="__p5001">Methods: BHPS is annual panel survey that has started in 1991 with currently completed 17th wave of data. Response rate to wave 1 was 74%, and response between waves 2 and 17 varied between 84%-89%. There are 3,696 individuals for whom self-rated health and/or GHQ-12 at age 16-21 (study outcomes) and maternal employment data prior to age 16&#x000a0;years are available. Other variables, such as gender, maternal age, maternal education and marital status, household income or maternal smoking were used as additional explanatory variables. Regression modeling in STATA 10 was used to estimate the associations between study outcomes and maternal employment.</p><p id="__p5002">Results: 19% of young adults aged 16-21 reported poor self-rated health, and mean GHQ-12 was 10.1. Approximately 40% of mothers worked at some point during age 0-4 of their child. This proportion increased to 59% at age 5-11 and 68% at age 12-16. Children of mothers who were not employed reported OR of poor SRH 1.48, 1.11 and 1.28 for 3 periods of exposure, however these effects were mostly explained when adjusted for maternal education and household income. The differences in GHQ-12 by maternal employment were similarly reduced by indicators of social position.</p><p id="__p5003">Conclusions: The associations between maternal employment in childhood and young adults&#x02019; health exist at least partly because of the generally higher social position and more stable family structure of households with working mothers.</p><p id="__p5004">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jitka Pikhartova, MD, Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL, London, WC1E 6BT; j.pikhartova@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="__p5005">9:42&#x000a0;AM-10:00&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5006">OS37-E</p><p id="__p5007">WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS AND ATTITUDES IN ADOLESCENTS IN TREATMENT FOR OBESITY VERSUS A COMMUNITY SAMPLE</p><p id="__p5008">Eleanor R.

Research has shown that obese youth may be at risk for engaging in maladaptive weight control behaviors, which increase risk for complications and impede weight loss. The current study examined weight control behaviors (WCB) and attitudes among youth in treatment for obesity as compared to community youth, including those matched for weight status and ethnicity to the clinical group, which was primarily (74%) African-American (AA).</p><p id="__p5011">Participants were from two samples of youth; one from public high schools (community sample; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;359, ages 13-19, 66% female) and one seen in treatment hospital-based clinic for either obesity or type 2 diabetes (clinical sample; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;42, ages 12-18, 57% female). Adolescents completed demographic measures and measures assessing body esteem and current WCB.</p><p id="__p5012">A MANOVA was conducted examining differences in body esteem and weight satisfaction (F(2,396) = 66.17, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Youth in the clinical sample reported lower body esteem than the community group. A MANOVA was also conducted comparing clinical youth to obese community youth (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;95th percentile; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;41; F(7,73) = 14.51, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and AA community youth (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;80; F(2,108) = 52.77, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Clinical youth reported lower weight satisfaction than obese or AA community youth. Via logistic regression, the clinical youth were significantly more likely to report exercise, eating less, and fasting to lose weight than the general or AA community youth. When compared to the obese community youth, clinical youth were more likely to eat less to lose weight.</p><p id="__p5013">In sum, the youth in treatment for obesity were significantly more likely to have lower body esteem and weight satisfaction than community youth, even obese or AA youth in the community. When compared to community youth, obese youth also engaged in more weight loss attempts, including maladaptive behaviors such as fasting. Findings suggest that treatment for obesity needs to include assessment and treatment of body esteem and weight dissatisfaction, as well as focus on avoiding maladaptive WCB.</p><p id="__p5014">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Eleanor R.

Siminoff, PhD</p><p id="__p5020">Department of Social and Behavioral Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA.</p><p id="__p5021">PURPOSE: To examine factors associated with appraisal delay (time between symptom recognition and seeing a physician [PHYS]) and diagnostic delay (time between first medical visit and diagnosis). METHODS: Individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) in the past 6&#x000a0;months who experienced symptoms prior to diagnosis are recruited to participate in an on-going qualitative research study. Participants are administered a semi-structured, cognitive interview about pre-diagnosis events and complete standardized scales. The interview focuses on: 1) symptom recognition, 2) influence of family and friends, 3) social support, 4) ease of access to care, 5) communication with PHYS, and 6) socio-demographic and psychological factors. Qualitative data is themed and coded. Self-report information is verified via chart review. 50 coded interviews (of 200 conducted to date) were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to individuals in the first tertile of appraisal delay (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20), individuals in the third (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) were more likely to not initially infer serious illness (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), decide not to seek medical attention (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), and experience behavioral delay in acting on a decision to seek medical attention (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) due to procrastination (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) or system barriers (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Compared to patients in the first tertile of diagnostic delay (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17), patients in the third (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) were more likely to have their PHYS fail to fully explore symptoms or investigate complaints (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), have the PHYS believe symptoms were not serious (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and experience referral delay (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and behavioral or scheduling delay with respect to referral appointments (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). CONCLUSION: In this sample, patients with longer delay did not appraise initial symptoms as important or requiring medical attention. Once deciding to see a PHYS, individual- and system-level factors interfered with making an appointment. Upon seeing a PHYS, patient and PHYS factors contributed to diagnostic delay, including not exploring symptoms or investigating patient complaints and delay in making referral appointments. Further investigation into factors moderating delay are warranted.</p><p id="__p5022">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Heather Rogers, PhD, MPH, Department of Social and Behavioral Health, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, 23233; hlrogers@vcu.edu</p><p id="__p5023">8:48&#x000a0;AM-9:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5024">OS38-B</p><p id="__p5025">DEMOGRAPHIC AND BEHAVIOURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LATER STAGES OF READINESS TO SCREEN FOR BOWEL CANCER: IMPLICATIONS FOR RESCREENING INTERVENTIONS</p><p id="__p5026">Amy Duncan, BHealth Science Hons,<sup>1</sup> Carlene Wilson, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Deborah Turnbull, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Ingrid Flight, BA, MPH,<sup>3</sup> Tess Gregory, PhD,<sup>1,2</sup> Ian Zajac, B Psychology Hons,<sup>2</sup> Stephen Cole, Bsc, MPH<sup>4</sup> and Graeme Young, MD FRACP<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p5027"><sup>1</sup>School of Psychology, Adelaide University, Adelaide, SA, Australia; <sup>2</sup>Medicine, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia; <sup>3</sup>Preventive Health Research Flagship, CSIRO, Adelaide, SA, Australia and <sup>4</sup>Bowel Health Service, Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park, SA, Australia.</p><p id="__p5028">Limited behavioural research is available concerning the differences between those who maintain continued adherence to Colorectal Cancer (CRC) screening guidelines and those who do not.

Levels of anxiety and depression did not differ across groups, but breast cancer survivors reported higher mammography specific distress (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that anxiety and mammography specific distress were positively associated with perceived risk in breast cancer survivors, but these associations were not found in women with no cancer history [Anxiety: Group x Perceived Risk B&#x02009;=&#x02009;.27, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;.11, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02; Mammography Specific Distress: Group x Perceived Risk B&#x02009;=&#x02009;.62, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;.21, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.004]. A similar trend was found for depression [Depression: Group x Perceived Risk B&#x02009;=&#x02009;.15, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;.08, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.06]. These findings suggest that breast cancer survivors with high perceived risk are more likely to experience distress during mammography. Strategies to help breast cancer survivors develop more accurate cancer risk perceptions and manage distress during mammography may be beneficial.</p><p id="__p5059">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Rebecca A.

Almost all developed countries have implemented a comprehensive care system to provide medical services to their citizens at low or no cost at the point of service&#x02014;universal health coverage (UHC) systems. In the past few years, UHC has risen to the forefront of the global health agenda, as reflected by donor pledges, international declarations, and high-profile publications. Under other banners, similar objectives have been advanced at the global level since the WWI era, first by private entities such as the Rockefeller Foundation&#x02019;s International Health Division and after WWII by the main institutions of the international post-colonial architecture, particularly by the WHO.</p><p id="__p5067">This paper investigates the historical origins of UHC systems and analyzes the politics surrounding the national decision to implement them. Understanding how, when, and why countries have established UHC systems sheds light on current international assistance strategies to encourage the same transition in developing countries. First, I analyze definitions of UHC to distill the important elements and discuss their primary assumptions, including their commitments to solidarity, redistribution, and government responsibility. I then focus on the development of the two main financing models&#x02014;social health insurance (Germany) and general taxation (United Kingdom)&#x02014;and then follow global-level attempts to promote UHC over the past century.</p><p id="__p5068">Moving toward UHC is a renegotiation of the social contract and is hotly contested because it changes who gets what and who pays for it. As such it is primarily a matter of domestic politics. I find that international aid agencies have not played a significant role in fostering the spread of UHC systems in the past. Beyond the possibility of fostering international learning and providing resources, there is no clear evidence in support of any particular role for international actors in fostering UHC systems.</p><p id="__p5069">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jesse Bump, PhD, MPH, Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, 02115; jbump@hsph.harvard.edu</p><p id="__p5070">8:48&#x000a0;AM-9:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5071">OS39-B</p><p id="__p5072">CONSIDERATIONS MADE BY GENERAL PRACTITIONERS WHEN DEALING WITH SICK-LISTING OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED CONDITIONS</p><p id="__p5073">Liv H.

Several factors which may influence the decision making regarding sick-leave were identified: To which extent the patient manage to present his story, extensive prior knowledge of the patient, but also properties within the doctor himself: own experience as a patient, tendency to avoid conflicts and others. Strategies in dealing with sick-listing would be to initially comply with the patient&#x02019;s request in order to build alliance and then start to motivate for a return to work. Confrontation when they disagreed strongly on a sick note was another strategy mentioned, but at the same time risking that the patient would leave them for a more cooperative colleague.

The LSMS data is used to estimate health and consumption spending as well as examine certain health access variables. We assessed health-related impacts on household poverty using the methodology of van Doorslaer et al. (2006). Similarly, we constructed estimates of the proportion of the Guatemalan population incurring catastrophic levels of health expenditures to assess the financial risk of ill health using the methodology of Xu et al. (2003). We defined catastrophic health spending (on both inpatient and outpatient) as a level of health spending that exceeds 40% of a household&#x02019;s ability to pay, although other thresholds are obviously possible.</p><p id="__p5088">Results: There is both a high level and inequitable distribution of financial burden due to ill health in Guatemala.

As part of the Ministry of Health structure, PHI started its activities in 2003 aiming at providing services to 11.2 million families in the country not covered by traditional social insurance institutions. PHI counts with unprecedent financial public resources to carry out its activities. More than 70,000 workers of 17 categories in 32 states have been hired. Although workers were offered initially a temporary contract with no benefits such as social insurance, annual allowance and vacations, the Ministry of Health (MOH) along with the Ministry of Budgeting and the MOH&#x02019;s workers union decided to provide benefits defined by Law starting in 2008. So far, half of all workers are contracted under the new conditions. However, 2009 evaluation using a sample of 9 states, showed that initially the performance of workers in terms of productivity and quality of care has not necessarily improved raising questions about the way Human Resources for Health policies should be designed and applied to really generate improvements for the benefit of those populations covered by the program.</p><p id="__p5097">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Gustavo Nigenda, PhD, Center for Health Systems Research, National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, 62100; gnigenda@insp.mx</p><p id="__p5098">9:42&#x000a0;AM-10:00&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5099">OS39-E</p><p id="__p5100">APPLICATION OF IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM: PARETO VERSUS LIBERTY PRINCIPLES IN CONDITIONAL FOREIGN AID</p><p id="__p5101">Yanfang Su, ScD</p><p id="__p5102">Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA.</p><p id="__p5103">The aim of this research is to demonstrate why in global governance Pareto principle from an economic perspective and liberty principle from a political perspective are incompatible.

Depression has been hypothesized to reduce the chances of a succesful IVF-outcome, and a number of studies have reported associations between depression and IVF-outcome. Other studies, however, have been unable to replicate these findings, and the strength of a possible association between depressive symptoms and pregnancy chances following IVF remains to be clarified. Our aim was therefore to conduct a statistical quantitative review of published articles reporting on the association between depression and IVF-outcome and to estimate the strength of such an association. Methods: Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, PsychInfo and Web of Science, identifying prospective empirical studies reporting data on associations between depression and IVF-outcome, i.e. pregnancy. Results: The forward database searches resulted in 14 accessible independent studies, providing the necessary and unadjusted data for Effect size calculations. A simple vote count showed a significant effect of depression on IVF-outcome in 4 of these studies. Effect size correlations (ESR) were calculated by two independent researchers for each individual study and then combined to estimate an overall effect size for the depression-IVF-outcome association. Due to considerable heterogeneity (Q&#x02009;=&#x02009;131,10; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), a random effects model was applied. The overall effect size found for the association between depression and IVF-outcome was statistically significant, with a higher number of depressive symptoms being associated with reduced pregnancy chances (ESr&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0,06, failsafe N&#x02009;=&#x02009;114, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Conclusion. A modest influence of depression on IVF-outcome was found. While the Failsafe-number indicates a relatively robust result, further studies are needed to explore possible moderators of the depression - IVF-outcome effect: e.g. female age, IVF inductees or veterans, duration and timing of presence of depressive symptoms.</p><p id="__p5116">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Signe M.

Neuroendocrine, immune, inflammatory, and cardiovascular factors have been suggested as possible mediators of the relationship between stress and birth outcomes, and recent data suggest that stress-related changes in cytokine production and inflammation may contribute to these effects. Work in our laboratory has focused on quantifying the effects of perceived stress and social support on pregnancy outcome and the degree to which neural-immune interactions may be involved in these effects. Initial work in the lab focused on establishing connections between maternal prenatal stress and low social support and alterations in cytokine balance in the circulation and cytokine production by stimulated peripheral lymphocytes. This work indicated that indeed, elevated stress and lower social support was related to increases in circulating inflammatory mediators, reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines, and similar changes in the production of cytokines in vitro by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Additional studies began to connect these findings to the likelihood of premature delivery and other complications of pregnancy, and have started to demonstrate that indeed, increased stress and distress early in pregnancy is related not only to elevations in inflammatory mediators in the prenatal period, but is also associated with higher frequency of pregnancy and birth complications. Most recently, our work has focused on the role of maternal ethnicity and acculturation in the impact of stress on pregnancy, and on the role of catecholamines in these relationships. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines were lower levels of support and higher stress throughout pregnancy, and higher social support was associated with higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines late in pregnancy. Moreover, elevated inflammatory markers were related to higher pregnancy-specific distress early in gestation, as well as lower 1-minute APGAR scores, lower gestational age at birth, and increased occurrence of birth complications including meconium aspiration, nuchal cord, and asphyxia. Together, these studies indicate that psychosocial factors are related to increases in inflammatory mediators and subsequently, increased risk of pregnancy complications and untoward birth outcomes.</p><p id="__p5123">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Mary Coussons-Read, PhD, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, 80217-3364; Mary.Coussons-Read@ucdenver.edu</p><p id="__p5124">9:24&#x000a0;AM-9:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5125">OS40-D</p><p id="__p5126">INFLUENCE OF MATERNAL PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS, DIETARY QUALITY AND PLACENTAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1ST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY</p><p id="__p5127">Eileen Fowles, PhD, RNC-OB</p><p id="__p5128">School of Nursing, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.</p><p id="__p5129">A pregnant woman&#x02019;s dietary quality during the 1st trimester of pregnancy has a profound effect on placental development, which can result in diminished supply of nutrients to the fetus, thus inhibiting proper fetal growth. However, little is known about low-income women&#x02019;s dietary quality during the 1st trimester when placental development is vulnerable to changes in maternal nutrition. The aims of this study were to explore the relationships 1) between maternal psychosocial factors and dietary quality; and 2) between dietary quality and selected placental biomarkers. A descriptive design was used in a clinic sample of low-income women (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;30). Women were, on average, 24&#x000a0;years old and 8&#x000a0;weeks pregnant. Most were unmarried, uninsured, and Hispanic. Spearman&#x02019;s rho statistic was used to analyze data due to small sample size and skewed data. Women (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) were, on average, 24&#x000a0;years old and 8&#x000a0;weeks pregnant. 1st Study Aim Social support was related to vegetable intake (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.37) and intake of iron-rich (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.478) and folate-rich (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.50) foods. Emotional eating in response to anxiety was negatively relationship to intake of fruits (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.33) and calcium-rich (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.33). Depressed women had less social support (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.43), more emotional eating (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.38), and decreased intake of foods rich in calcium (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.38), iron (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.60), and folate (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.49) 2nd Study Aim Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor was positively related to fruit intake (r&#x02009;=&#x02009; .40) and Placental Growth Factor was negatively related to the intake of iron (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.43) and zinc (-.38). partner support partner was related positively to vegetable intake and negatively to intake of iron and grains. Although results should be interpreted with caution, the findings suggest that low-income pregnant women who are depressed or engage in emotional eating are likely to have inadequate intake of nutrients that contribute to positive pregnancy outcomes. Placental development in the early weeks of pregnancy may be influenced by maternal dietary intake. More research is needed to explore the relationships among psychosocial status, dietary intake and placental development in the first trimester of pregnancy.</p><p id="__p5130">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Eileen Fowles, PhD, RNC-OB, School of Nursing, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78701-1499; efowles@mail.nur.utexas.edu\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583827833568" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figav_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figav_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figav_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583827833568" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p5131">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Imke Janssen, PhD, Preventive Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, 60612; Imke_Janssen@rush.edu</p><p id="__p5132">OS41</p><p id="__p5133">8:30&#x000a0;AM-8:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5134">OS41-A</p><p id="__p5135">DEMOGRAPHIC AND TRANSTHEORETICAL MODEL VARIABLES PREDICT FUTURE ALCOHOL DRINKING BEHAVIORS</p><p id="__p5136">Rose Marie Ward, PhD, Angela Coppola, BA and John Ward, PhD</p><p id="__p5137">Miami University, Oxford, OH.</p><p id="__p5138">Alcohol use and abuse on US college campuses is not a new idea.

Thus, we examined whether alcohol use mediates the relationship between forced sexual intercourse (FSI) and suicidality in adolescent girls. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative survey of US students conducted by CDC. Responses from Hispanic (H) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1915), Caucasian (W) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2928), and African American (AA) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1521) females in grades 9 - 12 were examined. FSI history was assessed by asking the following yes/no question: &#x0201c;Have you ever been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when you did not want to?&#x0201d; The outcome variable, suicidality, was measured by a single yes/no item: &#x0201c;During the past 12&#x000a0;months, did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide?&#x0201d; Alcohol use, was assessed by asking, &#x0201c;During the past 30&#x000a0;days, on how many days did you have 1 or more drinks of alcohol?&#x0201d; Responses were dichotomized as &#x0201c;yes/no&#x0201d; to having one or more drinks of alcohol on at least 1&#x000a0;day in the past 30&#x000a0;days. Results: The mean age of girls in the overall sample (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;6364) was 16 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.22) with a mean grade of 11th. Overall, 11% of participants reported a lifetime history of FSI. AA girls (14.2%) were more likely than W (10.5%) or H (11.3%) girls to report a lifetime history of FSI (&#x003c7;2 (2) = 13.33, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Nineteen percent of participants considered suicide in the past year, with H (21.5%) more likely than AA (18.2%) and W (18.2%) participants to report this behavior (&#x003c7;2 (2) = 9.18, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Additionally, 45% of participants acknowledged alcohol use, with W (47.4%) and H (49.4%) girls more likely than AA girls (34.6%) to report alcohol use (&#x003c7;2 (2) = 78.08, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). FSI was associated with suicidality (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.26, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;.08, OR: 3.53, 95% CI: 3.00-4.16, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) and alcohol use (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.69, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;.08, OR: 2.00, CI: 1.70-2.36, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) for the total sample. Alcohol use was associated with suicidality after controlling for FSI (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.80, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;.07, OR: 2.22, CI: 1.93-2.55, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). The path from FSI to suicidality was reduced when accounting for alcohol use (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;.09, OR: 3.22, CI: 2.70-3.83, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), suggesting that alcohol use partially mediated the relationship between FSI and suicidality (Sobel&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.16, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). The overall group results held for each ethnicity: AA (Sobel test&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.95, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), W (Sobel&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.55, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), and H (Sobel&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.35, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Conclusion: Results suggest the need for closer monitoring of adolescent sexual assault victims who also use alcohol to intervene in suicide behaviors.</p><p id="__p5148">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Yen-Chi L.

In this presentation we focus on the subjective evaluation of social and economic changes in Central European population undergoing fast societal transformation, and its relationship with alcohol consumption.</p><p id="__p5155">Methods: The sample of 8,856 men and women aged 45-69&#x000a0;years in the Czech part of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial Indicators in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study completed a questionnaire and examination in 2002-2005 that included rating of social and economic changes since 1989 (changes in occupational position, income, material circumstances and general social position), evaluation of drinking habits (both in terms of absolute consumption and drinking patterns), and a range of other covariates. 4 domains of change were coded into three categories: good change, no change, bad change. The analyses were then conducted for single domains and for a sum score indicating the overall rating of change. The CAGE questionnaire score, the score of drinking-related problems and mean annual intake of alcohol were used as the outcomes, and regression modelling was used to analyze the association between the exposures and the outcomes taking range of covariates into the account. The analysis was done separately for men and women.</p><p id="__p5156">Results: After controlling for age, sex and range of possible confounding variables, the persons who rated the changes as negative have more alcohol-related problems and alcohol abuse (odds ratios of a high CAGE score 1.30 for men and 1.76 for women for those reporting negative change compared to those reporting no change).

In Thailand, a significant increase among individuals aged 15-24 has been reported. Bangkok Behavioural Surveillance has shown different prevalence of alcohol use between schools. However, many studies on factors influencing alcohol use have not appropriately accounted for school level variation</p><p id="__p5165">Method: A random survey of fifteen secondary schools and fourteen vocational schools in Bangkok Metropolitan Administration was conducted in 2007. A total of 2,405 students aged 15-18 participated in the study. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were applied to investigate the significance of explanatory variables in predicting alcohol use and binge drinking in the past month. Explanatory variables included gender, age, school type (secondary or vocational), self-esteem, family relationships, peer relationships, school and neighbourhood connectedness.</p><p id="__p5166">Result: Self-reported prevalence of alcohol drinking and binge drinking in the past month were 28.5% and 5.8%. There was significant variance between schools both in alcohol use and binge drinking. The student and school explanatory variables explained 81% and 70% of the school variance in binge drinking and alcohol use respectively. Significant risk factors for binge drinking were being male (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.6), aged 17-18 (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5), vocational school (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.6) and significant protective factors were family bonding (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5), school performance (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5) and neighbourhood safety (0.6). Similarly, being male (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.8), aged 17-18 (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3), vocational school (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.3) and peer bonding (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.6) found to be significant risk factors for currently alcohol use, while school performance (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7) and neighbourhood safety (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8) played as protective factors. There was no relation between self-esteem and alcohol use or binge drinking.</p><p id="__p5167">Conclusion: The findings suggest that factors influencing alcohol use and binge drinking are complex after accounting for school level variance. Effective school intervention is needed to integrate different components of risk factors.</p><p id="__p5168">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Somsak Wongsawass, MPH, School of Public Health and Communitiy Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NT, 2052; somsakw@student.unsw.edu.au</p><p id="__p5169">9:42&#x000a0;AM-10:00&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5170">OS41-E</p><p id="__p5171">THE EFFECTS OF THE YEAR 2004 REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF ALCOHOL ON ALCOHOL-RELATED HARM IN FINLAND - A NATURAL EXPERIMENT BASED ON REGISTER DATA</p><p id="__p5172">Kimmo Herttua, PhD</p><p id="__p5173">Department of Sociology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.</p><p id="__p5174">There was a large reduction in the price of alcohol in 2004 in Finland due to a reduction in alcohol taxes by one-third, on the average, and due to the abolition of travellers&#x02019; duty free allowances from the EU. The present study investigated the effects of this reduction in alcohol prices on alcohol-related and all-cause mortality, alcohol-related hospitalisation, and interpersonal violence.</p><p id="__p5175">This study used several population-based register data and statistical Methods: Time series intervention analysis modelling was applied to monthly aggregations of deaths and hospitalisation in 1996-2006 for men and women aged 15&#x000a0;years and over. Socioeconomic differentials in alcohol-related mortality and interpersonal violence data were analysed with a before/after design. Alcohol-related mortality was defined using information on both underlying and contributory causes of death. Hospitalisation related to alcohol was defined as those with a reference to alcohol in the primary diagnosis.</p><p id="__p5176">The results of this study indicated that alcohol-related deaths increased substantially among persons aged 50-69&#x000a0;years after the price reduction when trends and seasonal variation were taken into account. The increase was mainly due to liver diseases. In contrast to alcohol-related mortality, mortality due to cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality decreased considerably among men and women aged over 69&#x000a0;years. Among persons aged 30-59&#x000a0;years, the increase in absolute terms was largest among the unemployed or early-age pensioners and those with low education, social class, or income. The employed and persons aged below the age 35 did not suffer from increased alcohol-related mortality. Alcohol-related hospitalisation rates in both chronic and acute causes for men increased among those below the age 70, and for women in the 50-69&#x000a0;year-olds. The increase was mainly due to mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol. The rates in interpersonal violence did not increase.</p><p id="__p5177">These findings suggest that reduction in alcohol prices may lead to a substantial increase in alcohol-related mortality and morbidity. However, large population group differences were observed. Those in the older age groups may even benefit from cheaper alcohol in terms of decreased rates of CVD mortality. Moreover, reductions in alcohol prices do not necessarily affect interpersonal violence. The population group differences in the effects of price changes should be acknowledged, and therefore, the actions of policy should be focused on the population subgroups which are primarily responsive to the price reduction.</p><p id="__p5178">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Kimmo Herttua, PhD, Department of Sociology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, 00014; kimmo.herttua@helsinki.fi</p><p id="__p5179">OS42</p><p id="__p5180">8:30&#x000a0;AM-8:48&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5181">OS42-A</p><p id="__p5182">EXERCISE ADHERENCE IMPROVES LONG-TERM PATIENT OUTCOME IN PATIENTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE HIP AND/OR KNEE</p><p id="__p5183">Martijn Pisters, MSc, PT,<sup>1,2</sup> Cindy Veenhof, PhD, PT,<sup>1</sup> Fran&#x000e7;ois Schellevis, PhD, MD,<sup>1,3</sup> Jos Twisk, PhD,<sup>3</sup> Joost Dekker, PhD<sup>3</sup> and Dinny de Bakker, PhD<sup>1,4</sup>\n</p><p id="__p5184"><sup>1</sup>Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL), Utrecht, Netherlands; <sup>2</sup>Utrecht School of Health Sciences, Utrecht University Medical Center, Utrecht, Netherlands; <sup>3</sup>EMGO Institute, VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands and <sup>4</sup>Tranzo, Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands.</p><p id="__p5185">Objective: To determine the effect of adherence within and after an exercise therapy treatment period on patients&#x02019; outcome on pain, physical function and patient self-perceived effect in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and/or knee.</p><p id="__p5186">Methods: One hundred fifty patients with OA of the hip and/or knee receiving exercise therapy were followed 60&#x000a0;months.

Total hip replacement is the most common and successful surgical treatment. An alternative to the conventional total hip arthroplasty (THA) is hip resurfacing, which is considered to be a solution for treatment of young and active patients with osteoarthrosis. Aim of the study was to gain a detailed insight into the physical activity behaviour of patients after hip resurfacing and to compare it to the physical activity behaviour of a gender- and age-matched group of total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients and a normative population.</p><p id="__p5196">Method: A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted, including all patients who underwent hip resurfacing one to four years previously. The SQUASH questionnaire was sent to these patients to determine physical activity behaviour. Resurfacing patients were matched on gender and age with patients after THA and a normative population.</p><p id="__p5197">Results: Of in total 50 patients after hip resurfacing, 46 patients participated (response rate 92%). The resurfacing group shows significantly more total physical activity than the THA group and the normative group. Compared to the THA patients, resurfacing patients showed significantly more light and vigorous intensity physical activity. The hip resurfacing group and the normative group show an equal amount of persons fulfilling the international health-enhancing physical activity guidelines (67.4%).</p><p id="__p5198">Conclusion: Patients after hip resurfacing are more physically active compared to gender and age matched patients after THA and even more active than a gender and age matched normative population. Although hip resurfacing is claimed to be the solution for active patients with hip osteoarthrosis, consequences on the long term of increased physical activity on risks concerning implant failure and wear have to be established yet.</p><p id="__p5199">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Inge van den Akker-Scheek, PhD, Orthopaedics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, 9700 RB; i.scheek@orth.umcg.nl</p><p id="__p5200">9:06&#x000a0;AM-9:24&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5201">OS42-C</p><p id="__p5202">MANAGING CHRONIC ORO-FACIAL PAIN: A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF THE EXPERIENCES OF PATIENTS, DOCTORS AND DENTISTS</p><p id="__p5203">Sarah Peters, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Vishal Aggarwal, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Joanna Goldthorpe, MSc,<sup>2</sup> Cheryl McElroy, MPhil,<sup>2</sup> King Elizabeth, MRes,<sup>1</sup> Justin Durham, BDS, PhD<sup>3</sup> and Martin Tickle, FDS, PhD<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p5204"><sup>1</sup>Psychology, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; <sup>2</sup>Dentistry, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom and <sup>3</sup>Dentistry, University of Newcastle, Manchester, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p5205">Persistent unexplained pain in the face and surrounding tissues are common presentations to dental and medical services. Routine dental treatment of chronic oro-facial pain (OFP) primarily involves using splints to correct malocclusion or teeth-clenching/grinding. However this mechanistic approach is ineffective. Moreover, such treatments can result in physical and psychological iatrogenesis. In contrast, a growing evidence-base recognises the effectiveness of psychological interventions for OFP, suggesting a role for psychological services within dentistry. In order to translate research into practice, further understanding is needed of patients&#x02019; and physicians&#x02019; current experience of OFP and its management. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 25 patients and 35 clinicians (comprising medical and dental practitioners from a range of primary and secondary care services). Audiotaped interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically using principles of constant comparison to categorise emergent and recurring themes within and between transcripts. Thematic categories arising in initial interviews were explored subsequently and disconfirmatory evidence sought until thematic saturation arose. Similar themes emerged from both patients and physicians. Whilst both sets of participants recognised the role that psychological factors could play in the development and maintenance of OFP, management and self-management strategies were largely limited to biomedical interventions. Achieving a diagnosis proved problematic but functional for both parties. Frustration at the current inadequacy of OFP management often led to conflict with (or disengagement from) the clinician-patient relationship. Current management of OFP is ineffective and unsatisfactory for both patients and clinicians and impacts on their relationship. A key barrier to implementing psychological interventions for OFP is the ineffective communication between physicians and patients, and between medical and dental practitioners.</p><p id="__p5206">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sarah Peters, PhD, Psychology, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL; sarah.peters@manchester.ac.uk</p><p id="__p5207">9:24&#x000a0;AM-9:42&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5208">OS42-D</p><p id="__p5209">VITALITY AND THE COURSE OF LIMITATIONS IN ACTIVITIES IN OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE HIP OR KNEE</p><p id="__p5210">Gabriela M. van Dijk, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Cindy Veenhof, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Cornelia H. van den Ende, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Guus J.

These shifts are due in part to rapid urbanization and globalization processes, which are contributing to significant changes in behaviors and living situations among populations in these countries. The growing burden of chronic diseases on developing nations is increasing attention on risk factors such as physical inactivity. The U.S. Task Force on Community Preventive Services developed the Guide to Community Preventive Services (the Community Guide) to evaluate the effectiveness of different health promotion interventions, including strategies to increase physical activity in communities. These recommendations have not been systematically examined and applied in developing countries. Project GUIA was initiated in 2005 to examine and promote evidence-based strategies to increase physical activity in Latin America. Its three aims are: (1) to conduct a systematic review of the Latin American literature on physical activity promotion strategies in the community and carefully examine the Community Guide&#x02019;s applicability; (2) to evaluate two ongoing physical activity interventions in Brazil, and (3) to disseminate evidence-based approaches for promoting physical activity in community settings. Coordinated by the Prevention Research Center in St. Louis, this Project involves cross-national collaboration with multiple academic and governmental institutions, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO/PAHO, the Brazil Ministry of Health, Universidade Federal de S&#x000e3;o Paulo and CELAFISCS. This presentation will highlight the project&#x02019;s aims, results of the literature review, findings from an evaluation in Recife, Brazil that is now being replicated in San Diego, California, and results from a social network analysis that has been conducted among partners promoting physical activity in Latin America. The presentation will highlight key lessons from this cross-national collaboration that include the need for a clearer understanding of context, the role of inter-sectoral partnerships, the need to better understand translation of an effective intervention from one population to another.</p><p id="__p5250">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Ross Brownson, PhD, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63110; rbrownson@wustl.edu</p><p id="__p5251">SS27b</p><p id="__p5252">CONTEXTUALIZING HIV PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS THAT WORK</p><p id="__p5253">Geoffrey Setswe, PhD, MPH</p><p id="__p5254">Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria, South Africa.</p><p id="__p5255">Introduction: Many HIV prevention interventions have been tested for efficacy or effectiveness. However, in almost three decades of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we are still not sure which interventions work best in preventing HIV transmission in different communities and cultural settings. This presentation provides evidence of HIV prevention interventions that work and also presents lessons learned about applying them in different contexts.</p><p id="__p5256">Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing HIV prevention interventions for evidence of efficacy or effectiveness was conducted. The interventions were classified as biomedical, behavioral and structural. The evidence provided by RCTs was graded in four different levels: best (80% or more), good (60-79%), promising (30-59%) and poor or no evidence (&#x0003c;30%). We calculated the effect size to show the difference between treated and control conditions.</p><p id="__p5257">Findings and Discussion: Using the grading system, male and female condoms and PMTCT were classified as best evidence HIV prevention interventions because they had achieved more 80% level of efficacy or effectiveness. ART, male circumcision, HIV Counseling and Testing for people who test positive were classified as good evidence HIV prevention interventions as they had achieved between 60 and 79% level of efficacy or effectiveness. Treatment of STI, a microbicide called PRO2000, the RV144 Thailand vaccine trial and a structural community RCT that reduced intimate partner violence were classified as promising evidence HIV prevention interventions as they had achieved between 30 and 59% level of efficacy or effectiveness. All other interventions that obtained less than 30% effectiveness were classified as poor or no evidence.</p><p id="__p5258">We will present the effect size of these interventions.</p><p id="__p5259">Conclusion: There is no &#x0201c;magic bullet&#x0201d; for HIV prevention, particularly as applied in different cultural settings. The lesson learned is that the acceptability of intervention strategies is not the same across most cultures and individuals. A community should choose to use a combination of interventions that best suits their context from among best, good or promising practices.</p><p id="__p5260">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Bonnie Spring, PhD, Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60610; bspring@northwestern.edu</p><p id="__p5261">SS27c</p><p id="__p5262">PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS: HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE GLOBAL EVIDENCE BASE FOR EFFECTIVE PREVENTION?</p><p id="__p5263">Brian F.

Efficacy trials conducted in developed countries have clearly demonstrated that lifestyle change and other kinds of non-pharmacological approaches can significantly reduce diabetes risk. Two key challenges are: (1) How to develop and implement programs that are more feasible for &#x02018;real world&#x02019; implementation and (2) How to extend the reach of such programs to low and middle income countries, as the current trial evidence based in such countries is currently very limited? This presentation considers the development, implementation and evaluation of such programs in Finland and Australia, as well as the recent uptake of lifestyle-related interventions for reducing diabetes risk in other countries. The GOAL study in Finland involved the &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; evaluation of a moderate-intensity group-based lifestyle change counselling program to prevent type 2 diabetes, adapted from the original Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS). Drawing on evidence from the Finnish DPS and the short-term results from the GOAL implementation trial, the Australian Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), adapted from the GOAL program, achieved similar positive behavioral and clinical outcomes. Currently, more routinized programs, that are building on the evidence from these &#x02018;real world&#x02019; implementation trials, are being implemented and evaluated in Finland and Australia. As key components of the Finnish GOAL program have become more refined over time, successive versions of the program in different countries are aiming to improve the &#x02018;fit&#x02019; between characteristics of the interventions, the adopters, and the implementation environments. Core components of the GOAL program are now also being adapted for use in programs that are currently being evaluated in Malaysia, India and South Africa. There is an urgent need for more collaborative and coordinated approaches that compare and contrast methods for adapting and spreading effective intervention programs between settings, regions, and countries.</p><p id="__p5266">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Brian F.

Pain threshold (PT), intensity (PI) and unpleasantness (PU) of a standard pressure stimulus were determined as well as sensory and affective pain (SP, AP).</p><p id="__p5343">Analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of sex for nearly all pain variables. Women exhibited a lower PT, rated pain to be more severe and unpleasant, and reported more SP and AP. Against our hypothesis gender role did not influence pain behaviour. Fear of pain (FPQ / PASS) and catastrophizing (PCS) showed significant correlations to all pain parameters except PT. The variable depressive symptoms was almost without influence whereas coping style modulated pain responsiveness. Gender Role Expectations of Pain (GREP) correlated only in a few cases with pain responses. Using sex and gender and all significant psychological variables as predictors in multiple regression analyses showed that essentially sex and fear of pain significantly predicted pain. PT was the only parameter that was not influenced by psychological variables. In summary, our study corroborated a distinct effect of sex regarding mechanical pain stimuli, showing women to be more responsive. In contrast the expected effect of gender role was not confirmed. Fear of pain seems to mediate the effect of sex on pain responsiveness, at least partially.</p><p id="__p5344">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Birgit Kr&#x000f6;ner-Herwig, PhD, Psychology, University of G&#x000f6;ttingen, G&#x000f6;ttingen, 37073; bkroene@uni-goettingen.de\n</p><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140583827570496" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figaw_HTML.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 12529_2010_9106_Figaw_HTML.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/bin/12529_2010_9106_Figaw_HTML.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140583827570496" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="">Open in a separate window</a></div><p>\n</p><p id="__p5345">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Wolfgang Hiller, PhD, University of Mainz, Mainz, 55122; hiller@mail.uni-mainz.de</p><p id="__p5346">SS29d</p><p id="__p5347">THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON CHRONIC FATIGUE SYMPTOMS</p><p id="__p5348">Urs Nater, PhD,<sup>1,2</sup> Brian Gurbaxani, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Christine Heim, PhD<sup>1</sup> and William C.

Stress has been suggested to play a role in the manifestation and maintenance of CFS. Various studies haven shown associations between different aspects of stress (e.g. childhood trauma, maladaptive coping, adult chronic stress) and fatigue. However, no studies have simultaneously measured and analyzed multiple characteristics of stress in one single study of CFS.</p><p id="__p5351">In the current population-based study, 501 participants took part and provided information on early life stress, personality characteristics, chronic stress, coping, cortisol as biological stress marker, and CFS symptoms. Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM, LISREL).</p><p id="__p5352">After comparing various theoretically sound models, the strongest model focused on the combined effect of childhood trauma and personality features. This model shows a strong effect of maladaptive personality features on CFS symptoms, in part mediated by adult chronic stress and coping. The impact of childhood trauma was significant, but the effect was lower than that of personality. SEM analysis indicates a good fit of this model (Chi2&#x02009;=&#x02009;855.19, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0, GFI&#x02009;=&#x02009;.88; AGFI&#x02009;=&#x02009;.85, CFI&#x02009;=&#x02009;.95, SRMR&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05; RMSEA&#x02009;=&#x02009;.071, p (RMSEA) = 0.0).</p><p id="__p5353">Our findings indicate the importance of stress in CFS. We have combined various aspects of stress in our study and were able to test a model encompassing a broad variety of stress characteristics.

Sawchuk, PhD and Milosh M. Raykov, PhD</p><p id="__p5364">Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.</p><p id="__p5365">Background: Attrition and workload are serious issues for faculty members, faculty associations and university administration. Despite the debates about methods for measuring workload, there is a high level of agreement that faculty members devote large amounts of time to their work, causing high levels of stress, and affecting their well-being and work commitment and. This study explores relatively underexamined questions related to factors affecting faculty members and their intention to leave their jobs, such as work demands, control over work, work-related rewards and stress pertinent to work in academic settings.</p><p id="__p5366">Methods: The faculty workload study was carried out using an online survey that completed 637 faculty members. The data on faculty intentions to quit, workload as an indicator of work demands, control over work, rewards, and work-related stress specific to the university setting were collected with a survey developed for this study. This study also collected open-ended, qualitative data that are included in the report, and compared this data with that from similar Canadian surveys, i.e., the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Work and Lifelong Learning Survey (WALL).</p><p id="__p5367">Findings: The study shows a high faculty workload, as demonstrated by the large number of work hours, significantly exceeding the national average found in the LFS and the WALL surveys (41% of faculty work more than 60 hours per week), and by the large number of courses taught during the academic year (24% of faculty teach five to eight courses). The results show significant bivariate associations between faculty&#x02019;s desire to leave their jobs with the majority of indicators related to workload, control over work, rewards, and work-related stress. Multiple logistic regression analysis, controlled for relevant demographic factors (age, sex and years of service), shows that faculty who perceive low control over work demonstrate the strongest likelihood of leaving their jobs (adjusted odds, AO&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.775), followed by those who perceive lack of rewards (AO&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.402), high work-related stress (AO&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.363), and higher workload (AO&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.278).</p><p id="__p5368">Conclusions: Similarly to the growing number of studies demonstrating that the control-demand and effort-reward models complement each other, this study identifies the important roles of both models of work-related stress, but suggests that among faculty members, control over work plays a highly important role in their intention to quit.</p><p id="__p5369">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Milosh M.

The sample was constituted by 100 female hospital-based nurses (Age: M&#x02009;=&#x02009;34.32; SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.15), from northern Portugal. Participants were assessed using a Demographic and Professional Form; the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Brief Personal Survey-R (BPS), to evaluate stress responses and coping resources; the &#x0201c;Job Content Questionnaire&#x0201d; (JCQ - SS), to assess co-worker social support; and the &#x0201c;Work-Family Conflict &#x00026; Family-Work Conflict&#x0201d; Scales, to measure the interference between work and home domains. Hierarchical regression analyses were computed to determine the significant predictors of health distress. The results of the GHQ-12 show clinical levels of distress in 73% of the nurses. General levels of distress were predicted by coping confidence (CC, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.28, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.005) and Work-Family Conflict (WFC. &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.30, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.004). Predictors for specific stress responses (BPS anger, guilt and pressure) were the same and in the same direction. In addition, co-worker social support predicted stress responses of guilt (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.19, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04) and anger (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.19, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04). The total variance explained by these predictors in nurses&#x02019; stress responses ranged from 15 to 27%. Some professional variables (night shift work and daily work load) and family variables (number of children at home) were also significant predictors of reported stress (variance explained ranging from 4 to 8%). Findings support the high incidence of distress in Portuguese nurses reported in other studies. Furthermore, the data points to the need to consider the family-home spill over in occupational health intervention programs. Coping resources and co-worker social support constitute key variables in reducing work stress among this population.</p><p id="__p5378">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Clara M.

The main outcome of the study was the duration of sickness absence, as registered by an occupational health service. Independent variables consisted of individual characteristics, lifestyle factors, work-related factors, and the work ability index. We used Poisson regression analyses with repeated occurrence of sick leave to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals of independent variables for the three categories of sick leave duration.</p><p id="__p5386">RESULTS: Predictors for sick leave lasting 2-12&#x000a0;weeks and &#x0003e;12&#x000a0;weeks were: older age, obesity, smoking, manual materials handling, lack of job control, lung restriction, and a less than excellent work ability. For most predictors, higher RR values were observed with a longer duration of sickness absence. Obesity, smoking, manual materials handling, and lack of job control remained important risk factors for moderate and long durations of sick leave after adjusting for the strong effects of work ability on sickness absence. The highest population-attributable fractions were observed for: age over 50&#x000a0;years (18%), manual materials handling (20%), and good (18%), moderate (28%), and poor (2%) work ability.</p><p id="__p5387">CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a variety of preventive measures targeted at smoking, obesity, physical load, psychosocial work factors as well as work ability will contribute to a reduction in the occurrence of sick leave.</p><p id="__p5388">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Padam P.

Yet, widowers have relatively higher excess mortality rate after the loss than widows compared to non-bereaved counterparts. When non-bereaved controls are not taken into account, widowers and widows show similar frequencies of symptoms and gender differences in coping with spousal bereavement appear to be relatively stable across previous studies.</p><p id="__p5398">Objectives: The aim was to investigate the importance of gender in relationship to other risk factors for poor bereavement outcome, using an integrative framework to enable the relative impact of different variables to be established.</p><p id="__p5399">Methods: 296 elderly bereaved people (Mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;73&#x000a0;years, 38% men) were examined at 2, 6, 13, and 18&#x000a0;months post loss using self-report scales measuring posttraumatic stress, coping style, crisis support, and personality factors.</p><p id="__p5400">Results: A selection of major risk factors was entered into a hierarchical linear regression. The model predicted 49% of the variance in long-term traumatic stress (18&#x000a0;months). When conducted for widows and widowers separately, the predictive power of the model rose to 62% for the widows and 58% for the widowers. For the widows, emotional coping, emotional loneliness, and satisfaction with social support predicted 62% of the variance. When early traumatic distress (2&#x000a0;months) was entered at the last step of the model, the predictive power of the model remained unchanged. For the widowers, sense of peace and satisfaction with social support predicted 40% of the variance in long-term traumatic distress. When early distress was entered, the predictive power of the model rose to 58%.</p><p id="__p5401">Conclusion: Stable, interpersonal traits such as emotional coping style may predict bereavement outcome well for widows, while strong early distress may be a better predictor for widowers. Frequently, widowers are excluded or combined with widows in research.

This study investigated sex differences in relations of subclinical cerebrovascular disease (SCD), brain atrophy (BA) and HRQoL in 154 healthy older adults (50.6% male; mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;66&#x000a0;years) free of major medical, neurologic, and psychiatric disease. Participants completed the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36) and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rated by a neuroradiologist for markers of SCD (i.e. periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities, number of silent infarcts) and BA (i.e. ventricular enlargement, sulcal widening). We create two rank-sum variables (SCD, BA) to serve as primary predictor variables. Multiple regression analyses (adjusted for age, race, education, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking, and Beck Depression Inventory scores) examined the interaction of sex with SCD and BA on HRQoL. Results revealed that for women, SCD was negatively related to the Mental Component Score of the SF-36 (MCS; rsq&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.09, b&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;4.26, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02).

Results suggest that deleterious changes in brain structure (particularly SCD) are related to poorer outcomes in mental health dimensions of older women&#x02019;s quality of life. Conversely, in men, brain atrophy relates to poorer physical function.

It has practical clinical implications because it constitutes a state of health that is still modifiable but is on the threshold to chronic irreversible health problems. In this study we analysed the development of frailty over a ten-year follow-up period in older Dutch men and women from different socioeconomic groups.</p><p id="__p5429">Methods: Data came from a nationally representative cohort of 1,509 men and women aged 55-85&#x000a0;years. Frailty was measured with the following markers: physical activity, and grip strength, BMI, cognitive functioning, vision and hearing problems. A maximum of 4 observations of the degree of frailty were acquired over a ten-year follow-up period. Indicators of socioeconomic position were education level and household income. We conducted several types of linear mixed model analyses to assess socioeconomic inequalities in the development of frailty, including complete case analyses, and with frailty imputed for those who died during follow-up.</p><p id="__p5430">Results: Adjusted for age, sex, and a partner being present inside the house or not, primary educated had higher odds of developing frailty than tertiary educated men and women (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.76; 95%CI: 1.05-2.97), and the lowest income groups had a higher odds than the highest income groups (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.90; 95%CI: 1.20-3.02). Interactions of education and income with time of frailty measurement suggested that the association of education and income with frailty increased during follow-up. Analyses with imputations for missing observations due to deaths yielded similar results. Conclusion: Having a high socioeconomic position is still protective against one of the core geriatric health problems; frailty. This suggests that differences in vulnerability late in life may account for socioeconomic inequalities in health at even later stages of life, but also that reversing these inequalities is partly feasible.</p><p id="__p5431">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Martijn Huisman, PhD, LASA, VU medical center, Amsterdam, 1081 BT; ma.huisman@vumc.nl</p><p id="__p5432">11:42&#x000a0;AM-12:00&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5433">OS44-E</p><p id="__p5434">PREDICTORS OF MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN ELDERS OF DIVERSE BACKGROUND ATTENDING AN EYE CLINIC</p><p id="__p5435">Patricia C.

However, there are very few studies to date that have sought to determine the relationship between objective functional status evaluations and subjective QoL measures in individuals after TBI. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between functional status and QoL over time controlling for demographics and injury severity after severe TBI.</p><p id="__p5472">Methods: This prospective study used longitudinal data collected from patient questionnaires and from medical records of subjects with severe TBI (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;46). In addition to demographic and injury related data, patient functional status was measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Patient QoL was evaluated using the Modified Perceived QoL questionnaire. Data was collected regarding 6&#x000a0;month and 12&#x000a0;month for both functional status and QoL. The baseline QoL was recalled by patients after TBI. A mixed effects model for repeated measures was performed to examine the relationship between each measure of functional status and QoL overall in patients 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after TBI while controlling for age, gender, injury severity and QoL at baseline respectively.</p><p id="__p5473">Results: Overall, QoL measure significantly improved over time (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

DRS was significantly and inversely associated with overall post-TBI trajectory QoL score (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). There is no relationship between FIM and overall post-TBI trajectory QoL score (P&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.10).

Municipalities in Japan offer elderly persons interventions consisting of group-based exercise sessions and behavioral counseling; however, for a variety of reasons, many individuals do not participate in the interventions. Some are physically frail, some have limited means of transportation and others are self-conscious about exercising with friends. Therefore, it is important to confirm the effect of low-frequency exercise participation compared with that of high-frequency. Thirty-nine participants, aged 67-85&#x000a0;years, participated in this study. All were identified as frail elderly persons according to the criteria of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan. The participants were divided into two groups that were assigned to different intervention schedules. The high-frequency group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14; 68-83&#x000a0;years) met 12 times over a 3-month period, while the low-frequency group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;25; 67-85&#x000a0;years) met 6 times over a 3-month period. Each 90-minute session consisted of group-based exercises and behavioral counseling. The exercises, which the participants were encouraged to practice daily at home, included 4 stretching and 6 strengthening exercises. To encourage exercise, 6 behavioral counseling sessions were offered in which illustrated stories or four-panel cartoons were used. After 3&#x000a0;months, members of both groups showed significant improvement in functional fitness as well as in 5 of 8 dimensions of QOL measured by the SF-36. Improvement in the social dimension of QOL was significantly higher in the high-frequency group than in the low-frequency group. Thus, both low- and high-frequency interventions offer significant positive effects for frail elderly persons. If elderly individuals need a great amount of socialization, a high-frequency intervention is recommended.</p><p id="__p5482">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Ryosuke Shigematsu, PhD, Faculty of Education, Tsu, 514-8507; rshige@edu.mie-u.ac.jp</p><p id="__p5483">11:42&#x000a0;AM-12:00&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5484">OS45-E</p><p id="__p5485">MEDIATORS OF ADHERENCE AFTER A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS</p><p id="__p5486">Laura Q.

Identifying mediators of PA maintenance is important for assisting BCS in adopting sustainable PA behavior change. Because we have reported continued improvements in PA 3&#x000a0;months after completing a PA behavior change intervention for BCS, our study aim was to determine if the change in social cognitive theory (SCT) constructs during the intervention mediated the effect of our intervention on PA. We randomized 41 BCS to receive a SCT-based 3-month PA behavior change intervention (INT; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;21) or usual care (UC; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20). The INT group received 12 supervised aerobic exercise sessions tapered to home-based exercise. Behavioral support was provided in 6 discussion groups and 3 individual face-to-face counseling sessions. The UC group received written materials. PA (i.e., accelerometer) and SCT constructs (i.e., survey) were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention (i.e., 3&#x000a0;months), and 3&#x000a0;months post-intervention (i.e., 6&#x000a0;months). The mediation of the intervention effect on PA at 6&#x000a0;months by changes in SCT constructs from baseline to 3&#x000a0;months was examined using the Freedman and Schatzkin approach. Compared to UC, the INT group reported improved barriers interference (mean difference&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;7.8; 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;15.1 to -.4; d&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.67; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04) and PA enjoyment (mean difference&#x02009;=&#x02009;.7; 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0 to 1.5; d&#x02009;=&#x02009;.61; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.06). Barriers self-efficacy d was .28 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.38). Barriers interference and self-efficacy mediated 39% (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.004) and 19% (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02) of the intervention effect on sustained adherence, respectively. In conclusion, only barrier interference and barriers self-efficacy significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on PA 3&#x000a0;months after intervention completion. The increase in enjoyment did not explain sustained PA improvement. Our results suggest that reducing barriers may partially explain the ability of our intervention to demonstrate longer term PA adherence.</p><p id="__p5489">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Laura Q.

We report 6-month nutrition data from a 2-year multidisciplinary weight management program for obese adolescents, the T.E.E.N.S. Program (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;173 at baseline, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;66 at 6&#x000a0;months). At baseline, participants were 76% African American, 65% female, with a mean age of 13.7. Mean BMI percentile was 99.1 (mean BMI z-score&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.5) at baseline. Repeated measures MANOVAs were used to examine differences from baseline (T1) to 6-month (T2) follow-up on a 24-hour dietary recall measure. Changes in anthropometrics and blood lipid parameters were also evaluated. At 6-months, participants significantly reduced their intake of calories, fat, sodium, and sugar (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05); no changes in calcium or fiber intake were found (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.05). Gender stratified models showed that boys had greater increases in fruit and vegetable and vitamin D intake compared to girls (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Significant improvements in body mass index and lipid profiles were found in the total sample (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Multiple regression analysis suggested that caloric reduction from baseline to 6-month was associated with decreases in BMI z-score (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.11, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). However, when parental compliance with nutrition visits was included in the regression, change in calories was no longer significant. Parental compliance became the only significant predictor of 6-month BMI z-score, while controlling for baseline BMI z-score (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.16, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01). Findings suggest that promoting intake of essential nutrients may be more challenging than reducing excessive intake. Additional gender specific strategies for dietary modification may be warranted.

It is even more challenging for obese persons with either depression or pain, but the impact of these conditions may differ. The present study examined the effects of depression and pain on perception of barriers to PA, confidence about engaging in PA, and current weekly PA in a group of overweight/obese male veterans. Study participants completed the Barriers to Being Active Quiz, Exercise Self-efficacy Scale, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The study sample included 101 male Veterans with BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25. The mean age was 61.2&#x000a0;years. Of the sample, 62.4 % reported a painful medical condition (i.e., either arthritic joint pain or back pain) and 48.5% reported a clinically significant Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;15. Reporting a pain condition was marginally associated with depression (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.064). Of the study sample, 85.9% reported weekly PA, ranging from walking to vigorous activity. Amount of activity was brief; only 27.7% reported PA&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 hour. Two factor ANOVAs assessed the contributions of both pain and depression on barriers to PA and exercise self-efficacy. Results revealed a main effect for depression on three of seven perceived barriers to PA: lack of energy, motivation, and skill level. In contrast, a main effect for pain was revealed for one barrier, fear of injury, as well as for exercise self-efficacy (p&#x02019;s&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Veterans with pain (but not depression) were less likely to report engaging in weekly PA (X2&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.0, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). Results suggest that although frequently comorbid in obese Veterans, depression and pain are associated with different perceived PA challenges. Depressed Veterans are more likely to report energy and motivational barriers to PA, while Veterans with pain are specifically concerned about hurting themselves during exercise and are less confident that they could actually engage in exercise under challenging conditions. In turn, veterans with pain are less likely to engage in any weekly activity.</p><p id="__p5504">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Patricia H.

Public responses have focused on alerting individuals to the risks associated with obesity and the urgent need for intervention and self-regulation. However, there is limited understanding of the impact of these messages on obese adults. This study sought to explore obese individuals&#x02019; perceptions and attitudes of population based obesity messaging in Australia, how they applied these messages to themselves and how personal and social contexts and experiences influenced these perceptions.</p><p id="__p5520">Method: We adopted a qualitative approach which utilised in-depth semi-structured telephone interviews with a community sample of obese adults (Body Mass Index 30 and over). Theoretical, purposive and strategic sampling techniques were used to ensure a broad representation of individuals from different demographic and geographical backgrounds. We analysed the data using a descriptive thematic approach.</p><p id="__p5521">Results: One hundred and forty two adults participated in this study. Participants&#x02019; attitudes were strongly influenced by personal and contextual factors, including personal experiences with weight and weight loss attempts. Participants felt that messages were overly focused on the physical rather than emotional health consequences of obesity i.e. the risk of getting cancer, or dying from obesity. Many, particularly those who were severely obese, described feeling stigmatised and blamed by the simplicity of messages and the lack of realistic solutions available to them. Whilst they trusted government based messages, they acted upon the solutions provided by the commercial weight loss industry. Participants supported non-stigmatising messages from non-commercial sources that were focused on encouraging individuals to make healthy lifestyle changes, rather than promoting weight loss.</p><p id="__p5522">Conclusion: This study is the first step in exploring the ways in which we understand how obesity messages resonate with obese individuals in Australia and influence their weight loss behaviours. However, further qualitative and quantitative research is needed before we fully understand the impact of obesity messaging on the health beliefs, behaviours and wellbeing of obese adults.</p><p id="__p5523">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sophie Lewis, BmedSci, School of Primary Health Care, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, 3168; sophie.lewis@med.monash.edu.au</p><p id="__p5524">11:42&#x000a0;AM-12:00&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5525">OS46-E</p><p id="__p5526">OBESITY, BARIATRIC SURGERY, PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLAINTS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY</p><p id="__p5527">Susana Silva, PhD Student and Angela Maia, PhD</p><p id="__p5528">School of Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.</p><p id="__p5529">Objective: Bariatric surgery has been indicated as a preferential treatment for morbid obesity and is associated with a set of physical and psychological improvements.

Preliminary results indicate that at the time of surgery, participants reported more passive coping, more problems and physical health complaints than in the 6&#x000a0;months follow-up. 12&#x000a0;months after, there is an increase of psychopathology, passive coping and physical complaints.</p><p id="__p5532">Conclusion: The prevalence of adverse childhood experiences is lower when compared with other studies with this population. There is an improvement on current functioning and quality of life after 6&#x000a0;months, however, these gains are going to be blurring the end of 12&#x000a0;months. Obese seem to use more passive coping strategies and do not actively involve in solving their problems.

Consequently, it is not surprising that a substantial number of studies have revealed that HNC patients are susceptible to experiencing clinical levels of anxiety (including PTSD) and depressive disorders. Surprisingly however, there is a paucity of psychological studies targeting the management of stress and depressive disorders in this population. Similarly, there are only a very limited number of studies that have evaluated the efficacy of psychotherapy programs tailored for other types of oncology populations (including breast, prostate, and gastro-intestinal cancers) specifically suffering from clinically elevated anxiety or mood disturbances. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been shown to be helpful in managing anxiety and depression in various psychiatric and health populations. Several studies have found the early application of a brief version of CBT, to be a useful treatment in reducing severe acute stress, as well as preventing the development of chronic psychological disorders in survivors following non-cancer traumatic events. Accordingly, the aim of the present RCT study (still in progress) was to test an early, brief (6-session) CBT program in reducing clinically elevated posttraumatic stress and depressive responses in newly diagnosed HNC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The efficacy of the CBT program was compared to a 6-session Supportive Counselling (SC) intervention. Participant inclusion criteria comprised adult individuals (aged 18 - 70&#x000a0;years) who met subthreshold or full diagnostic criteria for cancer-related PTSD and/or comorbid anxiety and depression disorders, and who had been prescribed to receive radiotherapy as part of their medical treatment for their HNC. To date, 25 patients have been randomized to receive either the CBT or SC intervention, and 16 patients have completed the therapy program. The results to date indicate that the CBT program is effective in reducing both posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms, as well as enhancing social well-being. Findings will be discussed in context of the utility of this early brief intervention in treating acute stress and preventing chronic psychopathology in traumatized cancer patients. Discussion will also focus on logistical considerations in conducting psychotherapy concurrent with medical treatments in oncology populations.</p><p id="__p5541">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Maria Kangas, PhD, Centre for Emotional Health/Dept of Psychology, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, 2109; maria.kangas@mq.edu.au</p><p id="__p5542">10:48&#x000a0;AM-11:06&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5543">OS47-B</p><p id="__p5544">EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS TRAINING ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS IN CANCER PATIENTS AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP</p><p id="__p5545">Richard Br&#x000e4;nstr&#x000f6;m, PhD,<sup>1,2</sup> Pia Kvillemo, MSc,<sup>1</sup> Yvonne Brandberg, PhD<sup>1</sup> and Judith Tedlie Moskowitz, PhD<sup>3</sup>\n</p><p id="__p5546"><sup>1</sup>Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; <sup>2</sup>Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden and <sup>3</sup>Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Unversity of California San Fracisco, San Francisco, CA.</p><p id="__p5547">There is increasing recognition of mindfulness and mindfulness training as a way to decrease stress and increase psychological functioning. The aims of this study were to examine the effects of mindfulness stress reduction training on perceived stress, psychological well-being and levels of cortisol, and to examine if changes in mindfulness mediate intervention effects on these outcomes. Seventy women and one man with a previous cancer diagnosis (mean age 51.8&#x000a0;years, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.86) were randomized into an intervention group or a wait-list control group. The intervention consisted of an 8-week mindfulness-training course. A repeated measures MANCOVA showed that compared to participants in the control group, participants in the mindfulness-training group had significantly decreased perceived stress, post-traumatic avoidance symptoms, and increased coping self-efficacy at 6-month follow-up (F16, 51&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.32, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Those who participated in the intervention reported significant increase in mindfulness when compared to controls (F10, 57&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.34, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The increase in mindfulness mediated the effects of the intervention on perceived stress, and coping self-efficacy. The results indicated and intervention effect on awakening cortisol. Among those with initial low levels of cortisol, there was an increase from baseline to 3-month follow-up, and among those with initial high levels there was a decreased level of cortisol at 3-month follow-up. There was an association between changes in stress symptoms and cortisol levels. This study indicates that increased levels of mindfulness can potentially explain reduction of stress symptoms resulting from mindfulness stress reduction training. The results indicated a normalization of cortisol levels as a result of the intervention. The importance of these findings for future research in the field of mindfulness is discussed.</p><p id="__p5548">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Richard Br&#x000e4;nstr&#x000f6;m, PhD, Karolinska Institute, New York, NY, 10065; richard.branstrom@ki.se</p><p id="__p5549">11:06&#x000a0;AM-11:24&#x000a0;AM</p><p id="__p5550">OS47-C</p><p id="__p5551">AN EXPRESSIVE WRITING INTERVENTION IMPROVED SELF-REPORTED HEALTH AMONG EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS HIGH IN REPRESSIVE COPING: PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A POPULATION-BASED, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL</p><p id="__p5552">Mikael B.

The Teachable Moment (TM) model suggests that there are certain times when an individual is especially ready to change behavior and thus, open to receiving messages about behavior change. According to the TM model, experiences that jointly (1) increase risk perceptions, (2) prompt concordant emotional responses, and (3) impact self-concept may offer a powerful motivational context for promoting behavior change. Further, tailoring smoking cessation interventions on TM components may increase the salience of health messages.</p><p id="__p5565">In the present study, TM model was used to examine the desire to quit smoking among family members of lung cancer patients. Further, the relationship between desire to quit and engagement with and reactions to self-help smoking cessation materials was examined. Participants were family members of lung cancer patients recruited for a randomized controlled trial testing a counseling intervention for smoking cessation. The main independent variable was lung cancer diagnosis in a family member and the main dependent variable was intention to quit smoking.</p><p id="__p5566">Study results indicated that components of the TM model were related to desire to quit in family members of lung cancer patients. Specifically, increased perceived risk, negative self image, and high subjective norm for quitting were related to high desire to quit. In a final path analysis model that controlled for age, sex, ethnicity, education and smoking rate, the construct of perceived individual risk of cancer was identified as a mediator of the relationship between having a family member with a diagnosis of lung cancer and quitting intention. Findings on engagement with and reactions to materials were mixed. Engagement with materials was not related to baseline desire to quit, but was related to positive reactions to the materials. Those with a higher desire to quit were more likely to report that the information in the tailored booklet applied to them, and was new to them, interesting, trustworthy, and moving. Finally, family members with a higher desire to quit were more likely to say that the information in the booklet make them want to quit smoking.</p><p id="__p5567">Evidence from this initial study indicates that the TM model provides a strong conceptual framework for (1) identifying specific determinants of desire to quit among family members of lung cancer patients; and (2) developing effective tailored self-help materials for this population. These data suggest that the concept of the teachable moment may be adopted and adapted for the smoking cessation in the oncology context in Indian set up.</p><p id="__p5568">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Sanghamitra Pati, MD DNHE MPH, Medical Education, SCB Medical College, Bhubaneswar, 751022; sanghamitrapati@yahoo.com</p><p id="__p5569">11:42&#x000a0;AM-12:00&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5570">OS47-E</p><p id="__p5571">REHABILITATION OF CANCER SURVIVORS IN DENMARK - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON THE EFFECT OF A MULTI-FOCUSED PSYCHOSOCIAL REHABILITATION COURSE</p><p id="__p5572">Nina Rottmann, MSc,<sup>1</sup> Hanne W&#x000fc;rtzen, MSc,<sup>1</sup> Susanne O.

In the Danish population of 5.4 million people, more than 300 000 are cancer survivors. Given the range of physical, psychological and social late effects of cancer and its primary treatment many survivors need tailored rehabilitation interventions. This randomized study evaluates the short term effect of a multi-focused, psychosocial 6-day residential rehabilitation course at the Dallund Rehabilitation Centre in Denmark.</p><p id="__p5575">Methods: Breast, prostate or colorectal cancer survivors were randomly assigned to the rehabilitation course (IG) or a standard care control group (CG). Outcome measures included self-reported quality of life (qol), psychological mood and mental adjustment styles and were assessed at baseline, 1-, 6- and 12-month follow up. Multiple linear regression was used in preliminary analyses to compare differences between IG and CG. Global qol at baseline, cancer diagnosis, age, gender and education were examined as confounders.</p><p id="__p5576">Results: The preliminary analyses included 352 patients (IG n&#x02009;=&#x02009;165 and CG n&#x02009;=&#x02009;187). A total of 188 patients had breast cancer, 94 had colorectal cancer and 70 had prostate cancer. Participants were on average 61&#x000a0;years old and 228 were women.

In particular, prenatal stress is associated with long-term disturbances in HPA axis function.A sample of 115 10-year old children was examined in a cross-sectional study design. The experimental group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;43) was characterized by a glucocorticoid treatment of their mothers due to high risk of preterm delivery during the second trimester. Control group A (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;35) consisted of children who were at risk of being born prematurely but did not receive glucocorticoid treatment. In control group B (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;37) children were included born after complication-free pregnancy. A standardized psychosocial stress test for children (TSST-C) was applied. All children were healthy and showed no disparities in their level of development. Salivary cortisol and heart rate were measured during the experiment as well as psychological parameters using self-report questionnaires (EWL-KJ and PASA). The TSST-C induced a marginally significant increase of salivary cortisol (F(4.814,269.601) = 1.939, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.091). Significant higher cortisol levels were observed in children of the experimental group as compared to children of control group B. Referring to the data for the heart rate in response to the TSST-C a trend towards significance was revealed (F(15.069, 836.313) = 1.505, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.096). lower heart rates were found in The experimental group showed lower heart rates than the control groups A and B. Furthermore, stress appraisal and mood significantly differed between the three groups.Even though all children were comparable concerning their level of education and mental abilities, we found subtle differences in their psychobiological stress reactivity. The prenatally stressed offspring demonstrated a stronger glucocorticoid response in reaction to challenging situations than controls.

Our paper makes the case for the inclusion of adolescence as a distinct stage in life course studies. We introduce a model to capture the most important pathways and mechanisms working over adolescence to develop adult health inequalities, and review and include relevant literature to illustrate the evidence for these pathways and mechanisms.</p><p id="__p5612">For each of the four pathways: the health-, the health behaviour-, the relational- and the educational pathway, the paper investigates whether indicators are socially patterned in adolescence, whether they track into adulthood, and whether any socially differential tracking or -vulnerability has been investigated. The paper focuses on examples of indicators from each pathway that is prevalent and/or have serious implications for later life: pains, overweight, depression, low physical activity, low fruit/vegetable intake, smoking, alcohol consumption (behavioural indicators), lone parenting, bullying victimization (relational indicators) and education.</p><p id="__p5613">Most health indicators are socially patterned in adolescence and track into adulthood, with higher risks of adverse outcomes among individuals from lower socioeconomic positions. Adolescent health behaviours track into adulthood. Smoking, physical activity and especially fruit and vegetable intake are socially patterned, while evidence for social patterning of alcohol-use is less consistent. Lone parenthood and bullying are socially patterned and track over time, and there are indications of a socially differential vulnerability to the effects of these types of relational strain.</p><p id="__p5614">Very little research has investigated the social patterning over time or studied social vulnerability of most of the above indicators from adolescence to adulthood. However, all four mechanisms: socially differential exposure, tracking, socially differential tracking and socially differential vulnerability seem to be active in establishing social differences in adult educational attainment.</p><p id="__p5615">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Pernille Due, MD, National Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, Copenhagen, 1353; pdu@niph.dk</p><p id="__p5616">\n<strong>Saturday</strong>\n</p><p id="__p5617">\n<strong>August 7, 2010</strong>\n</p><p id="__p5618">\n<strong>SYMPOSIA SESSIONS</strong>\n</p><p id="__p5619">\n<strong>2:30&#x000a0;PM-4:00&#x000a0;PM</strong>\n</p><p id="__p5620">SS32</p><p id="__p5621">HEALTH OUTCOMES IN CHILDREN AFFECTED BY TRAUMA</p><p id="__p5622">Annette M.

Evidence suggests that devastating natural disasters (such as hurricanes and bushfires) (La Greca et al. 1996; Yelland et al., in press), injuries resulting from motor vehicle and other types of accidents (Meiser-Stedman et al., 2008), and life-threatening medical conditions such as cancer (Phipps, Jurbergs &#x00026; Long, 2009) are associated with the development posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms and disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. Although existing research has focused on mental health reactions of child trauma victims, very little attention has been devoted to the health effects of traumatic events. This is especially surprising, in that stress has long been known to affect immune functioning and susceptibility to disease.</p><p id="__p5625">Nevertheless, there has been recent interest in the health effects of children&#x02019;s trauma exposure (Fairbank &#x00026; Fairbank, 2009), and this symposium will address this issue. The three papers in the symposium address the impact of traumatic stressors on child health. Each of the papers in the symposium focuses on different traumatic stressors and their potential health effects. The first paper by Kenardy, Anderson, and Le Brocquehus focuses on the predictive value of posttraumatic stress on health outcomes in a large sample of children with mild to severe traumatic brain injury. The second paper by La Greca and colleagues will present two recent studies that examined the impact of destructive natural disasters (hurricanes) on children&#x02019;s somatic symptoms. Finally, the third presentation by Llabre and Hadi presents data on two studies of the psychological and health consequences of war exposure on children. All authors will discuss the implications of their findings for assessing children affected by traumatic events.</p><p id="__p5626">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Annette M.

However, little research has examined the health consequences of disasters. This presentation focuses on two studies of the impact of hurricane exposure on children&#x02019;s somatic symptoms. Study 1 examined Hurricane Charley (2004, Category 4); Study 2 examined Hurricane Ike (2008, Category 2).</p><p id="__p5632">Study 1 included 385 children (55% girls; M age&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.7&#x000a0;years). At 9&#x000a0;months postdisaster, children completed measures of hurricane exposure, life events, and PTSD; 21-months postdisaster children reported ongoing stressors, life events, and somatic symptoms. Hierarchical regressions revealed that hurricane experiences accounted for 7.2% of the variance in somatic symptoms at Time 2 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001). Time 1 PTSD also predicted Time 2 somatic symptoms (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001), but hurricane experiences were not significant when PTSD symptoms were included. Major life events added to the prediction of Time 2 somatic symptoms (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001).</p><p id="__p5633">Study 2 included 328 children (50% girls; M age&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.72&#x000a0;years) who completed similar measures 9&#x000a0;months post-disaster. Using regression to predict somatic symptoms, demographics were entered first (8% of the variance, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01); then hurricane-exposure (14% of the variance, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001); and finally children&#x02019;s PTSD symptoms (16% of the variance, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). In the final step, only PTSD symptoms, child&#x02019;s age (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;.15) and stressors occurring during the hurricane (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.11) remained significant.</p><p id="__p5634">These studies are the first to examine health outcomes in children exposed to natural disasters. Children exposed to destructive disasters and who experience disaster-related stressors report significant somatic symptoms 9 and 21&#x000a0;months postdisaster. Findings suggest that children exposed to natural disasters may be vulnerable in terms of their physical health as well as mental health. Further attention the health status of children exposed to natural disasters is important in to address.</p><p id="__p5635">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Annette M.

One study, conducted in Lebanon after the Lebanese-Israeli war in the summer of 2006, included a population-based sample of over 6000 children in grades 1 through 12 who were assessed for multiple exposures, prior exposure, sociodemographic characteristics, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS). The prevalence of PTS symptoms was estimated at 27.7% in children who were in grades 1 to 5 and at 26.4% in children and adolescents in grades 6 to 12. Specific symptom clusters had higher prevalence. Between 41-53% (depending on age) reported difficulty in falling and staying asleep. Older age was associated with increased symptoms. Past and concurrent exposures to war-related events were the strongest predictors of PTS symptoms. The other study included 151 Kuwaiti children who were 7-10&#x000a0;years old during the first Gulf war, selected for participation based on their level of exposure to war-related events. Participants were assessed two years after the war and again as young adults (19-23&#x000a0;years old). As adults they reported on their general health, medical diagnoses, and sleep habits. At both assessments they reported on symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. A structural model supported the notion that psychological distress mediates the effect of war exposure on self-rated health, quality of sleep, and obesity.</p><p id="__p5641">The session will conclude with a brief discussion with all presenters participating</p><p id="__p5642">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Maria Llabre, PhD, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, 33124; mllabre@miami.edu</p><p id="__p5643">SS32c</p><p id="__p5644">DOES POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS PREDICT HEALTH OUTCOMES IN CHILDREN WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY?</p><p id="__p5645">Justin Kenardy, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Vicki Anderson, PhD<sup>2</sup> and Robyne Le Brocque, PhD<sup>1</sup>\n</p><p id="__p5646"><sup>1</sup>CONROD, University of Queensland, Herston, QLD, Australia and <sup>2</sup>Murdoch Children&#x02019;s Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia.</p><p id="__p5647">Research on Iraq War veterans who have experienced traumatic brain injuries has found that posttraumatic stress mediated the effect of the brain injuries on health outcomes.

These conditions are described by common subjective health complaints such as musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal discomfort, tiredness, fatigue, allergic and respiratory complaints, depression, and anxiety. Subjective health complaints are common in the general population. For most people the complaints are minor everyday nuisance, however for some it becomes substantial and is given a diagnostic label and professional help is needed. An important question is why and to whom this happens. A possible mechanism for such multiple symptoms could be somatic and cognitive sensitization. Furthermore, two cognitive mechanisms that seem to be closely linked to the process of sensitization are worrying and coping. There is an increasing interest of health in media and in the population. This might lead to worries concerning features of modern life and its affect on health. Worrying could play a role by enhancing biased memory and interest of health related information, leading to sensitization. Therefore, modern health worries could be associated with health complaints and medically unexplained symptoms. Individuals that uses active problem solving coping strategies have been found to have lower levels of subjective health complaints than others in stressful work situations. An essential condition for coping to occur is that the individual expects a positive result of the handling of a stressful situation, i.e. positive response outcome expectancy. The result of no control of the outcome would be learned helplessness and negative response outcome expectancy could be defined as hopelessness. Both hopelessness and helplessness may lead to depression and multiple subjective health complaints. In this symposium the relationships between subjective health complaints, modern health worries and coping will be discussed.</p><p id="__p5658">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Camilla Ihlebaek, PhD, Research group for Nature, Health and Quality of life, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Aas, 1432; camilla.ihlebak@umb.no</p><p id="__p5659">SS34a</p><p id="__p5660">THE RELATIONSHHIP OF MODERN HEALTH WORRIES TO DEPRESSION AND SYMPTOM REPORTING IN THE GENERAL POPULATION</p><p id="__p5661">Keith Petrie, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Vera Baehr, MHS<sup>1</sup> and Winfried Rief, PhD<sup>2</sup>\n</p><p id="__p5662"><sup>1</sup>University of Auckland Medical School, Auckland, New Zealand and <sup>2</sup>Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.</p><p id="__p5663">Background: Worries about environmental and technical changes affecting people&#x02019;s health have been shown be associated with the use of health care services, health behaviours, mood and reporting of physical symptoms.</p><p id="__p5664">Aim: In a representative sample of the German population we examined the relationship of modern health worries to demographic factors. depression, symptom reporting and health-related quality of life.</p><p id="__p5665">Methods: 2,524 participants of a representative sample of the German completed the Modern Health Worries Scale, Depression and Somatization Module of the Patient Health Questionnaire, as well as the SF-12 health-related quality of life scale.

Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the association between variables.</p><p id="__p5676">Results: In the general population 12 % reported not to be interested in health information, 41 % were a little interested, 29 % were moderately interested, and 18 % were very interested. Women were more interested than men (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.000) and higher educated were more interested than lower educated (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.000). There were no age differences in health interest. The most common MHW were pesticides in food (76%), additives in food (73%), drug resistant bacteria (71%), climatic changes (69%), air pollution (68%) and depletion of the ozone layer (68%). The most common SHC were tiredness (43%), LBP (38%), shoulder pain (33%), headache (31%), sleep disturbances (31%), and allergic complaints (26%).

While patients felt severely ill, they experienced blame and dismissal. The findings illustrated how patients&#x02019; beliefs and causal attributions may oppose the doctor&#x02019;s understanding of the condition. For the patient, getting a diagnosis and knowing more was necessary for recovery. Doctors were reluctant towards the diagnosis, and struggled to maintain professional authority. For patients, experience of discreditation could lead to withdrawal and disengagement. Identity is challenged when the legitimacy of the illness is questioned. This burden adds to a loss of previously established identity and makes the patient vulnerable beyond symptom perception. CFS patients cope with their condition by trying to know more, by keeping a distance to protect themselves and learning more about their limits. Doctors can support patients&#x02019; coping by supporting the strong sides of the patients instead of casting doubt upon them. Furthermore, common ground for understanding can be enhanced by presenting disease models suggesting mechanisms of what happens in the body in CFS, such as sustained arousal with subsequent symptom maintenance. The Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress provides a framework for negotiating the impact of stimulus and response expectations and transcends the vicious circles of sensitization. The presentation will demonstrate how patient perspectives and disease models can be connected.</p><p id="__p5684">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Kirsti Malterud, MD PhD, Research Unit for General Practice, Uni Health, Bergen, Bergen, N-5018; kirsti.malterud@isf.uib.no</p><p id="__p5685">SS34d</p><p id="__p5686">MODERN HEALTH WORRIES AND SUBJECTIVE HEALTH COMPLAINTS IN A SENIOR POPULATION: A PILOT STUDY</p><p id="__p5687">Maria J.

Many countries have enacted laws banning smoking in public places as part of their strategy to decrease the ill effects of smoking. In some countries this strategy appears to be successful in reducing smoking and in reducing levels of non-smoker&#x02019;s exposure to SHS. In recent years some countries have banned smoking in pubs and bars, the last public venues where it was still allowed. Subsequent studies measuring SHS have shown dramatic drop in SHS following the ban. In 1983, a law banning smoking in public places in Israel was enacted and amendments to the basic law were added over the years. The latest amendment came into effect in 2007, adding pubs and bars to the list of public places in which it is prohibited to smoke.</p><p id="__p5738">Objective: To measure the adherence of bars and pubs with the law banning smoking in them, and to identify variables that may predict adherence to the law.</p><p id="__p5739">Methods: This study includes data collection from two sources. (1) Passive airborne nicotine monitoring devices used to measure indoor SHS in pubs and bars in about 20 Jewish-Israeli cities. (2) Face-to-face interviews with bar owners were conducted to identify variables predicting implementation of the law.</p><p id="__p5740">Results: Two years after the Israeli smoke-free law has come into effect levels of SHS in most of the pubs and bars remains relatively high, however, in some bars the ban is implemented. Smoking and SHS is higher in bars and pubs in cities where the city-hall does not enforce the law by sending inspectors to inspect bars and pubs and give fines. Bar owners respond directly to the chances of receiving a fine.</p><p id="__p5741">Conclusions: Although Israeli non-smoking legislation is progressive, enforcement is lacking, and smoking in public places still exists. Law enforcement is the responsibility of the local authorities, however, not enough has been done to enforce the law and city-halls should be encouraged to enforce the law more successfully as this has a profound effect on SHS in the pubs.</p><p id="__p5742">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Orna Baron-Epel, PhD MPH, School of Public Health, Haifa University, Haifa, 31905; ornaepel@research.haifa.ac.il</p><p id="__p5743">OS50</p><p id="__p5744">2:30&#x000a0;PM-2:48&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5745">OS50-E</p><p id="__p5746">STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS AND THE RISK OF IHD.

Background: CHD is the leading cause of death in the United States today, with family history (FH) long known as an important risk factor. We tested the hypothesis that those who believe that CHD is not preventable, possibly because they have a positive FH, do not alter their health behavior (in this case exercise) to be cardioprotective. Methods: Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of FH, preventability belief, and exercise for incident CHD. We first constructed a baseline Cox proportional hazards regression model of the association between incident CHD and FH controlling for age at baseline and Framingham risk score (an index of standard CHD risk factors). We then constructed a second Cox proportional hazards regression model to test if preventability belief was related to FH and a third model to test if belief could be viewed as a mediator of the FH-CHD relation. Finally we evaluated if the preventability belief-CHD relation was itself mediated by exercise .Results: Preventability belief was correlated with family history for both genders (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.724, 95% confidence interval [CI] .592-.885, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.005), with those that had a family history of heart disease less likely to believe that heart disease can be prevented. Preventability belief was also found to be a mediator between family history and CHD, but for women only (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.51, 95% CI 1.65-3.80, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001).

Close to a third of HF patients exhibit clinical levels of depressive symptoms. In turn, depression is associated with greater morbidity and mortality in HF. The mechanisms linking depression and worse outcome in HF are unclear. One suggested pathway links depression with heightened inflammation that may then be related to undesirable cardiac remodeling in HF. However, there have been mixed results in the literature connecting depression with inflammation in cardiac patients. Methods: The present study attempts to further delineate relations between depression and inflammatory markers in HF patients by using an exercise task to unmask group differences. Further, components of depression were examined separately to determine if inflammatory markers were differentially associated with somatic or cognitive depression symptoms. 40 NYHA II-IV HF patients and 35 healthy controls performed a moderate 20-min bicycle exercise task and completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), sub-categorized into somatic (BDI-s) and cognitive (BDI-c) symptoms. Plasma levels of IL-6 were measured at baseline, 10&#x000a0;min and 30&#x000a0;min after exercise. Repeated measures ANCOVA were performed, controlling for age, gender, body mass index and physical function. Results: Both HF patients and controls with elevated BDI-s exhibited higher plasma levels of IL-6 at baseline, which remained elevated until 30&#x000a0;min post- exercise task (time x BDI-s effect, F(8, 65)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.16, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.045). Meanwhile, those with lower BDI-s had reduced IL-6 levels across the entire period. In contrast, elevated BDI-c symptoms were associated with low IL-6 at baseline in both HF and non-HF groups, but then an increase in IL-6 in the non-HF controls by 30&#x000a0;min post- exercise (group x time x BDI-c effect, F(8,65) = 7.6, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.007). Conclusions: Elevated IL-6 levels until 30-min post task were associated with heightened somatic symptoms of depression, whereas HF patients with elevated cognitive symptoms had lower levels of IL-6 through 30&#x000a0;min- post exercise. By further understanding the components of depression associated with elevated inflammatory markers, interventions may be developed to specifically address symptoms of depression that may worsen cardiac outcomes.</p><p id="__p5768">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Laura Redwine, PhD, Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, 92161; lredwine@ucsd.edu</p><p id="__p5769">3:24&#x000a0;PM-3:42&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5770">OS50-D</p><p id="__p5771">RISK OF MULTIPLE PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS ON STROKE MORTALITY IN OLDER ADULTS</p><p id="__p5772">Kimberly M.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of multiple psychosocial factors on stroke mortality in older adults. Participants included 3,656 adults (59.9% African American, 40.1% non-Hispanic white; 61.2% female) with a mean (SD) age of 77.0 (6.2) years from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). CHAP is an ongoing, longitudinal study of risk for Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and other chronic conditions of the elderly. Mortality was ascertained through 12/31/05 and verified by data from the National Death Index; over 7.7&#x000a0;years of follow-up, 76 fatal strokes were identified. Prior principal component analysis on nine psychosocial questionnaires revealed three primary factors related to distress (depression, neuroticism, perceived stress, life satisfaction), social connectivity (social engagement, spirituality, social networks), and unfair treatment (hostility, perceived discrimination). Factor scores were computed by summing individual z-scores for each questionnaire loading on the factor. Cox models were conducted for each factor score adjusting for age, race, sex, education, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, physical activity, smoking and chronic conditions. Each 1-point higher distress score related to a significant 10% increase in stroke mortality [HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.10; 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.03-1.18; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.008]. Results were unchanged further controlling for history of stroke. There were no main effects of social connectivity and unfair treatment on stroke mortality. In this cohort of elderly African American and non-Hispanic white adults, higher levels of distress contributed significantly to greater risk of dying from stroke over nearly 8&#x000a0;years of follow-up. Additional research is needed to identify mechanisms underlying the association between distress and stroke mortality.

Adults suffering from food insecurity are at risk of inadequate nutrient intakes or, paradoxically, overweight/ obesity and the development of chronic disease. Despite the global financial crisis and rising costs of living, there are few studies investigating the potential dietary consequences of food insecurity among the Australian population. This study examined whether food insecurity was associated with weight status and poorer intakes of fruits, vegetable and takeaway foods among adults residing in socioeconomically-disadvantaged urbanised areas.</p><p id="__p5823">Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a random sample of residents (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1000) were selected from the most disadvantaged suburbs of Brisbane city (response rate 51%). Data were collected by postal questionnaire which ascertained information on sociodemographic information, household food security status, height, weight, fruit and vegetable intakes and takeaway consumption. Data were analysed using chi-square and logistic regression.</p><p id="__p5824">Results: The overall prevalence of food insecurity was 31%. Food insecurity was not associated with weight status among men or women. Associations between food security status and potential dietary consequences differed for men and women. Among women, food security was not associated with intakes of fruit, vegetable or takeaway consumption. Contrastingly, among men food security was associated with vegetable intakes and consumption of takeaway food: men reporting food insecurity had lower intakes of vegetables and were more likely to consume takeaway foods compared to those that were food secure.</p><p id="__p5825">Conclusion: Food security is an important public health issue in Australia and has potential dietary consequences that may adversely affect the health of food-insecure groups, most notably men residing in food-insecure households.</p><p id="__p5826">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Rebecca Ramsey, Bachelor of Health Science - Doctor of Philosphy, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, 4059; rebecca.ramsey@qut.edu.au</p><p id="__p5827">3:42&#x000a0;PM-4:00&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5828">OS51-E</p><p id="__p5829">RISK FACTORS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG FEMALE PAKISTANI IMMIGRANTS: THE INVADIAB-DEPLAN STUDY ON PAKISTANI IMMIGRANT WOMEN LIVING IN OSLO, NORWAY</p><p id="__p5830">Victoria T.

We examined changes in the social distribution of breast feeding and its effect on adult psychological well-being through the pathway of childhood psychological health by using the available cases from the National Child Developmental Study (NCDS, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;7,750, born in 1958) and the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;6,492 born in 1970).</p><p id="__p5845">Psychological well-being was defined in terms of measures of self-efficacy and psychological ill-health. Childhood adversity was measured by a dichotomised index created after tabulating information about parenthood, mother&#x02019;s age, mother&#x02019;s education, and presence of older siblings. Childhood psychosocial adjustment was measured by the Bristol Social Adjustment Guides for the NCDS and the Rutter scale graded by a teacher for the BCS70. We used logistic regression to test if there was an effect of breastfeeding on adult psychological well-being over and above the effects of adversity and psychosocial adjustment in childhood.</p><p id="__p5846">The effect of breastfeeding appears to be gender specific. Findings showed that the magnitude of the effect of breastfeeding on psychological well-being was larger in women than in men. After accounting for the effect of childhood social adversity, breastfeeding promoted psychosocial adjustment during childhood in girls in NCDS (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.25, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.05-1.48) and in BCS70 (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.44, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.15-1.81), but not in boys. In adulthood, being breastfed at birth was associated with higher self efficacy (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.31, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.06-1.61) and lower risk of psychological ill health (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.76, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.61-0.96) in women in BCS70 only. Although breastfeeding did not moderate the negative effect of childhood social adversity on childhood or adulthood outcomes in this study, findings suggest that the practice of breastfeeding can be important for women&#x02019;s psychological well-being throughout the life course.</p><p id="__p5847">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Noriko Cable, PhD, Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT; n.cable@ucl.ac.uk</p><p id="__p5848">2:48&#x000a0;PM-3:06&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5849">OS52-B</p><p id="__p5850">SIDE-EFFECTS OF INTRA-UTERINE HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION: ACCEPTABILITY OF UNSCHEDULED VAGINAL BLEEDING</p><p id="__p5851">Pamela Warner, PhD, Anna Glasier, PhD, Robert Lee, BSc, Anja Guttinger, MBChB and Hilary Critchley, PhD</p><p id="__p5852">Centre for Population Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.</p><p id="__p5853">Hormonal methods of contraception are highly effective, but in some users unscheduled vaginal bleeding occurs.

But still we have limited data, whether these &#x0201c;Modern Health Worries&#x0201d; (MHW, Petrie at al. 2001) are related to other anxieties and depression (and if so, to what extent). Furthermore we still do not know, whether these worries mean the same in women and men or have gender-specific relationships.</p><p id="__p5875">Method: 282 subjects (age 16 to 88, 68% women) completed questionnaires assessing MHW (German adaptation of the MHW), anxiety, depression, somatization and quality of life.</p><p id="__p5876">Findings: The majority of the participants confirmed strong worries, primarily with respect to drug resistant bacteria and pesticides in food, with stronger worries in female and older persons. Factor analysis indicatetd a four factors structure: &#x02018;Tainted food&#x02019;, &#x02018;Environmental pollution&#x02019;, &#x02018;Electromagnetic pollution&#x02019; and &#x02018;Toxins in houseold&#x02019; (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha .85 to .94). MHW scales were moderately correlated with depression and physical impairments, but not with somatization. Comparing women and men all four subscales have higher means in women. In addition these scores show different correlations with other psychological scales and constructs: While men with high scores in MHW report more other (general) sorrows and stress-related strains, MHW in women are (positively) related to life satisfaction, hedonistic orientation and good psychosocial health status.</p><p id="__p5877">Conclusions: The subjective importance of MHW could be demonstrated in this study, but the presumed closeness to somatization could not be confirmed.

However, both might contribute to health goal attainment, potentially interplaying with domain-specific psychosocial factors: Agency, mediated by health-related self-efficacy, and communion, moderated by available social support for the goal at hand.</p><p id="__p5885">We tested these hypotheses among the participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;385; women 73.2%, men 26.8%) of the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial to prevent type 2 diabetes. Health-related self-efficacy was measured at baseline (T1) and after the intensive phase of the intervention at 3&#x000a0;months (T2). Perceived social support received during the intervention was measured at T2. Waist circumference, indicator of abdominal overweight, was measured at T1, at one-year (T3) and three-year (T4) follow-ups. Agency and communion were measured at T4 with the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ).</p><p id="__p5886">Among women, higher agency was associated with a greater likelihood of at least 5% waist circumference reduction (WCR) by T3 (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.70, CI 95% 1.19-6.15); among men, the association was reversed (but only marginally significant p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.057). Further analyses in women&#x02019;s sample showed that agency and increase in self-efficacy independently predicted T1-T3 WCR (both p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). High communion was associated with WCR when social support was high (p-value for interaction term&#x02009;=&#x02009;.034).

However, sexual risk reduction interventions for drug users have traditionally focused on urban populations. We used qualitative techniques to understand rural African-American cocaine users&#x02019; perspectives on sexual risk and HIV/STI so that we could tailor an existing intervention to this underserved population. Using purposive sampling, 40 African-American cocaine users from two rural towns were recruited to participate in four focus groups, which were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Three investigators coded the data using content analysis and constant comparison. Three major themes emerged: HIV knowledge and beliefs, selling &#x00026; buying sex, and perceptions of condom use. Participants held many inaccurate beliefs about HIV, including how to identify high-risk partners. Attitudes about HIV testing varied by gender, with women being more accepting; however, most were doubtful about effective HIV treatments. Most participants had complex beliefs about trading sex, with &#x0201c;survival sex&#x0201d; seen as acceptable but &#x0201c;tricking for drugs&#x0201d; as unacceptable, despite reports that both types were common. Both men and women were socially classified as &#x0201c;dirty&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;nasty&#x0201d; based in large part on sexual trading behaviors. Participants viewed condoms as protective against HIV and STI, but also reported strong resistance to condom use by both men and women. They reported using hygiene as a proxy for gauging a potential partner&#x02019;s risk and therefore the importance of condom use. Significant knowledge deficits, high-risk beliefs, and social pressures appear to converge on rural African-American cocaine users and contribute to increased HIV and STI rates. These findings were incorporated into a social cognitive theory-based intervention to address these challenges and reduce risk behaviors.</p><p id="__p5896">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Katharine E.

Not only has the number of newly infected 15 to 29&#x000a0;year olds consistently increased over the last decade, the emergence of antiretroviral therapy has meant that those born with HIV are growing into adolescence and beyond. Consequently, HIV/AIDS is now being treated more like a chronic illness than a terminal disease. While much focus has been paid to identifying the specific factors that place individuals at risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV, little attention has been directed toward those behaviors that help promote health in the existing population of young people living with HIV (YPLH). These health protective behaviors can assist in prolonging lives. The preliminary data being presented here includes ninety-one participants who have completed their initial visits of a study assessing coping styles as predictors of adherence in urban YPLH. The sample was recruited from two clinics that serve adolescents with perinatal and risk-acquired HIV. The youth range from age 13 -22&#x000a0;years. Specific health protective behaviors were identified that either help promote immune functioning or delay disease progression in YPLH. Study participants responded to questions regarding their diet/nutrition, exercise, sleep habits and taking of multivitamins/supplements. Results highlighted some health protective behavior areas of promise and need. Most respondents reported eating vegetables and fruit &#x0201c;some days&#x0201d; of the week (71.4 % and 76.9 % respectively). In the month prior to baseline, only 32% reported eating fast food one or more times a week. More than half of the youth (50.6%) had at least 20 minutes of exercise less than 3&#x000a0;days a week. While a third of the group (33%/30 pts) walked briskly for at least 10 minutes daily. On the other hand, almost all participants reported eating candy, chips or cookies &#x0201c;some days&#x0201d; (52.7%) or &#x0201c;every day&#x0201d; (41.8%). Similarly, 73.7 % had less than 4&#x000a0;days of exercise in the prior month and 43% received less than the recommended amount of sleep. Health protective behaviors are an important aspect of managing care for urban YPLH.</p><p id="__p5904">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Ricardo D.

Still, 5 million people needing ART remain uncovered. Further, this progress is threatened by the global financial crisis making it urgent to estimate how funding changes will affect ART programs.</p><p id="__p5911">Methods: We quantify the impact of ART funding changes by modeling their effect on ART coverage and incorporating feedback from coverage to mortality, and from coverage to HIV incidence using a behavioral sub-model. We analyze the changes in ART coverage, HIV incidence, and mortality for several funding scenarios to make concrete policy recommendations. We apply our model to South Africa (SA) using published estimates of current ART coverage, ART effectiveness, HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, HIV transmission probabilities and the annual number of sexual partners.</p><p id="__p5912">Results: Universal ART coverage (UC) can be achieved in SA within a few years if funding increases every year at the rate it increased from 2007-08. In contrast, only maintaining current funding levels will result in declining coverage. Surprisingly, even a 1/3rd funding decrease over 3&#x000a0;years followed by increases at the 2007-08 rate delays achieving UC by 10&#x000a0;years. Increased prevention effectiveness can substantially reduce time to achieving UC. In contrast, increases in the CD4 count threshold for treatment eligibility could make UC very hard to achieve.</p><p id="__p5913">Discussion: Only continued increases in ART funding in coming years can ensure that ART coverage levels can be increased in the future. Policy choices, such as investment in prevention and ART eligibility criteria, will be crucial in ensuring the future success of the ART roll-out.</p><p id="__p5914">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Salal Humair, PhD, Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, 02115; salal@alum.mit.edu</p><p id="__p5915">OS54</p><p id="__p5916">2:30&#x000a0;PM-2:48&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5917">OS54-A</p><p id="__p5918">SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF THE DANISH VERSION OF THE DISTRESS THERMOMETER</p><p id="__p5919">Pernille E.

The results will be important for improved handling of psychosocial problems among breast cancer patients in Denmark. By targeting psychosocial support and rehabilitation to those who are most distressed we may be able to tailor the support and hence prevent that some patients develop clinical depression.</p><p id="__p5925">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Pernille E.

As most studies in the area are cross-sectional, relatively little is known about possible predictors. AIM: To explore the prevalence of pain and the role of depression as predictor in a nationwide prospective study of women treated for breast cancer. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 3343 Danish women (aged 26-70) treated for primary breast cancer according to standardized guidelines. A questionnaire package including Beck&#x02019;s Depression Inventory was mailed out 3- (baseline) and 15-months post-surgery (follow-up). The response rate at follow-up was 94%. Probable cases of major depression (MD) were identified according to the manual (cutoff&#x02009;&#x0003e;=&#x02009;17). Frequency and severity of treatment-related pain in breast and arm or shoulder was assessed by 4 items at follow-up (range: &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;all the time&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;extremely severe&#x0201d;). DBCG and the surgical departments provided data on eligibility, clinical variables and comorbidity. Data on psychiatric history, demographic-, and socioeconomic factors were obtained from national registries. RESULTS: At follow-up, 73% reported pain during the recent month and 33% had pain &#x0201c;almost every day&#x0201d; or more often. Twenty-eight percent were &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; or more affected by pain and 11% were &#x0201c;very&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;extremely&#x0201d; affected. Women with MD at baseline were more likely to experience pain &#x0201c;almost every day&#x0201d; or more often at follow-up (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.63; (95% CI, 2.12-3.27)) and more likely to be affected &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; or more by pain (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.49; (95% CI, 2.80-4.35)). When adjusted for potential confounders (demographic-, socio-economic-, clinical-, health status-, and health behavior variables), the predictive power of MD persisted (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.93; (95% CI, 1.50-2.48), and OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.31; (95% CI, 1.79-2.99)). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of treatment-related pain was substantial with nearly 3 out of 4 experiencing pain 15&#x000a0;months post-surgery and 1 out of 9 reporting to be very or extremely affected. Depression was found to be an important independent predictor of pain.</p><p id="__p5932">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Soeren Christensen, MSc, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DK-8000 C; soeren.christensen@aarhus.rm.dk</p><p id="__p5933">3:06&#x000a0;PM-3:24&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5934">OS54-C</p><p id="__p5935">THE EFFECTS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS ON NEUROCOGNITIVE AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN BRAIN TUMOR SURVIVORS</p><p id="__p5936">Maria Kangas, PhD,<sup>1</sup> Robyn Tate, PhD,<sup>2</sup> Janet Williams, CRN<sup>3</sup> and Robert Smee, MBBS, FRACR<sup>3</sup>\n</p><p id="__p5937"><sup>1</sup>Centre for Emotional Health, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia; <sup>2</sup>University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia and <sup>3</sup>Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.</p><p id="__p5938">AIM: Relative to other oncology populations, the brain tumor (BT) population is unique given that both benign and malignant BTs can be life-threatening and can cause severe neurocognitive and psychosocial disturbances. No study to date however, has investigated the effects of BT-related posttraumatic stress (PTSS) on neurocognitive functioning and overall quality of life in adult BT patients. The aim of the present study was to address this question. METHOD: Utilizing a longitudinal design, adult individuals diagnosed with a primary BT were assessed on average, within 6-weeks prior to starting radiotherapy (T1), and re-assessed at 3&#x000a0;months post-radiotherapy (T2). At both assessments, participants were administered a standardized battery of tests measuring BT-related PTSS, mood, quality of life, memory and executive functioning. RESULTS: To date, 64 patients (36 females, 28 males) have been re-assessed at T2. At both T1 and T2, 14% of the sample reported clinically elevated levels of PTSS pertaining to their BT experience; although, the effects of PTSS fluctuated over time. Whereas 40% of individuals who reported elevated PTSS prior to commencing radiotherapy continued to report elevated PTSS at T2, 60% of patients with elevated PTSS at T2 did not experience elevated PTSS at T1. Prior to radiotherapy (T1), individuals with elevated PTSS were found to have significantly reduced functional well-being, elevated BT symptoms and social constraints, as well as heightened depressive, anger, fatigue and confusion symptoms (p&#x02019;s&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) compared to patients with low PTSS at T1. Individuals with elevated PTSS also evidenced significantly reduced scores on working memory and executive tests (p&#x02019;s&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) compared to individuals with low PTSS at T1. Similarly, individuals with elevated PTSS at T2 reported significantly reduced functional well being, vigor, and overall quality of life, as well as elevated BT symptoms, depression, anger, confusion, and social constraints (p&#x02019;s&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) compared to individuals with low PTSS, 3-months post-radiotherapy. Individuals with high PTSS at T2 also performed significantly worse on working memory and executive tests (p&#x02019;s&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that approximately one in seven individuals diagnosed with a primary BT are at risk of suffering from PTSS as a result of their tumor experience. Notably, these results indicate that PTSS compromises neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning including overall quality of life in BT patients undergoing radiation therapy. The findings will be discussed in context of developing and implementing appropriate counseling and rehabilitation services to address the unique needs of BT survivors.</p><p id="__p5939">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Maria Kangas, PhD, Centre for Emotional Health / Dept of Psychology, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, 2109; maria.kangas@mq.edu.au</p><p id="__p5940">3:24&#x000a0;PM-3:42&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p5941">OS54-D</p><p id="__p5942">COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS TREATED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY AND TAMOXIFEN</p><p id="__p5943">Christna M.

The current results, however, have been inconclusive.</p><p id="__p5946">Objectives: To examine the effects of endocrine therapy (tamoxifen) on cognitive functioning in breast cancer patients.</p><p id="__p5947">Methods: 20 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen and 12 patients receiving chemotherapy only were assessed with neuropsychological tests before and again 4-6&#x000a0;weeks after completion of the chemotherapy.</p><p id="__p5948">Results: Group differences were only found for one out of 21 neuropsychological tests. When controlling for age, patients treated with both chemotherapy and tamoxifen scored significantly lower on the letter-number sequence test (WAIS-III LN) measuring working memory (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.013) than patients treated with chemotherapy only. Of the 21 tests, 5 showed differences corresponding to an effect size&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.3 (Cohen&#x02019;s d). These 5 tests were WAIS-III LN (letter-number sequence), WAIS-III A (Arithmetic), TMA (Trail-making A), RAVL (Rey Auditory Verbal learning) and WF-N-words (Word Fluency N-words) representing the cognitive domains of working memory, processing speed and verbal fluency.</p><p id="__p5949">Conclusion: While we cannot conclude that tamoxifen causes cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients, our results do not exclude the possibility. Our finding that 25% of the neuropsychological tests showed effect sizes greater than 0.3 are in agreement with results of previous studies. The small samples and subsequent low statistical power of existing studies suggest the need for large-scale studies. If tamoxifen causes cognitive decline in breast cancer patients, this knowledge could be relevant for the patients&#x02019; choice of treatment.</p><p id="__p5950">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Christna M.

One possible explanation for the low use of car restraints may be fatalistic beliefs, common in the Arab community. These beliefs suggest that health is a result of luck and beyond an individual&#x02019;s control.</p><p id="__p5968">Objectives: To asses levels of fatalistic beliefs and their association with child restraint in motor vehicles among Arabs in Israel.</p><p id="__p5969">Methods: A cross sectional observational study of child restraint in motor vehicles was conducted. Four hundred cars with 835 children under the age of 8 in them were observed while entering a parking lot. The drivers were interviewed regarding beliefs and attitudes towards child restraint and in addition their fatalistic beliefs towards road accidents and fatalistic beliefs in general. The observations were conducted within an Arab town and seven Arab villages in the northern part of Israel.</p><p id="__p5970">Results: Of the 400 drivers, 63% were restrained while driving the car while only 32% of the children in the cars were restrained. A higher percent of the children under one year old were restrained (64%) compared to 41% of the children aged 1to 3 and 9% of children aged 3-8. Around 60% of the drivers reported high fatalistic beliefs. High fatalist beliefs were associated with lower education and were more frequent among women. After adjustment for gender, age of driver, education, number of children and driver&#x02019;s restraint, fatalism was associated with child restraint.

Although parental support has been found to increase children&#x02019;s PA, few studies tested predictors and effects of parental support for PA among young Hispanic children. The main purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a multi-component intervention program on parental support for PA among predominantly Hispanic children from K to 2nd grade, accounting for parents&#x02019; characteristics such as acculturation, education, and age.</p><p id="__p5979">Design and setting: Quasi-experimental research design was used to evaluate a multi-component intervention program, in which five waves of data were collected from two sites in West Texas.</p><p id="__p5980">Subjects.

Since HIV in Togo - the most common cause of death, representing 17% of all deaths - is spread primarily through unprotected sex, safe sex practices such as condom use can reduce HIV spread significantly. We examined the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to promote condom use among Togolese young people at high risk for HIV infection. Methods: We randomized - without known HIV infection - 446 Togolese people aged 16 to 24&#x000a0;years consulting 3 sexually transmitted disease clinics in Lom&#x000e9;, who had recently had unprotected sex, to a 1-hour behavioral intervention or a didactic control condition. At baseline and 6&#x000a0;months, participants underwent interviews about their sexual behaviors and consistent condom use and testing for HIV. Results: We observed a 51% decline in HIV infection incidence (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03) in the intervention group. Incidence density for the intervention versus control groups was 1.6 versus 3.27 per 100 person-years (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Participants in the intervention group reported using condoms more consistently in the 30&#x000a0;days preceding the 6-month assessment (unadjusted analysis, intervention, 74.2% vs control, 48.7%). Participants in the intervention group reported using condoms more consistently over the entire 6-month period (adjusted odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.51-3.50; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;.001). Conclusions: This brief behavioral intervention shows promise in reducing HIV risk behaviors among Togolese young people and may be transferable to other sub-Saharan African countries.</p><p id="__p6002">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Lonzozou Kpanake, PhD, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3T 1E2; lonzozou.kpanake@mail.mcgill.ca</p><p id="__p6003">3:42&#x000a0;PM-4:00&#x000a0;PM</p><p id="__p6004">OS55-A</p><p id="__p6005">CORRELATES OF SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIORS AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN COLORADO: ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL-BASED HIV/AIDS PROGRAMS</p><p id="__p6006">Stephen Nkansah-Amankra, PhD, MPH, MA and Adoulaye Diehiou, PhD, MD</p><p id="__p6007">School of Human Sciences/Colorado School of Public Health, University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, CO</p><p id="__p6008">SUMMARY: To evaluate correlates of sexual risk behaviors associated with HIV/AIDS infection among adolescents participating in 2005 Colorado Youth Risk Behavioral Survey, since previous studies have produced mixed findings.

Efforts to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic among adolescents may need to focus on targeted interventions aimed at addressing gender- and racial/ethnic-specific risk exposures among this population group, including risk behaviors linked with lifetime sexual abuse. The need to re-examine the role of in-school HIV prevention programs to build adequate competencies among students, parents and community leaders is recommended.</p><p id="__p6009">STUDY DESIGN AND DATA SOURCE: We used cross-sectional data from the 2005 Colorado Youth Behavioral Risk survey (YRBS). Details of the survey design and psychometric validity of questionnaire items are found in other publications. Briefly, the YRBS is a self-reported paper-based survey of high school students conducted every two years by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with Colorado local implementing partners. The survey monitors risk behaviors and other characteristics associated with mortality and morbidity among students in grades 9 through 12. In 2005, the survey was administered to a representative sample of 1,498 students from 29 public high schools throughout the state, and the overall response rate was 60%. Surveyed schools and classes were selected systematically with probability proportional to enrollment based on grade levels.</p><p id="__p6010">OUTCOME VARIABLES: Sexual Risk Behavior was a three-level variable created from items suggested in previous studies, and categorized as: no risk (never had sexual intercourse or engaged in any sexual risk behavior at the time of survey), low risk (had sex with one partner, used condom and did not drink alcohol in the last sexual intercourse, and used a method of contraception) and high risk (had sex with multiple partners, did not use condoms and/or drank alcohol before the last sexual intercourse, and used no method of contraception). Age at first sexual intercourse was categorized based on respondents&#x02019; age at their first sexual intercourse as: no sexual intercourse (participants reported as not having ever had sexual intercourse at the time of survey irrespective of age), young adolescents (11&#x02013;14 years), and older adolescents (&#x02265;&#x02009;15 years). Number of current sexual partners was assessed based on the reported number of sexual partners in the 3 months preceding the survey and categorized as following: never had sexual intercourse, had 1 partner, and had &#x02265;&#x02009;2 sexual partners. These variables were selected because of their known association with transmission of HIV infections (Mullings, Marquart &#x00026; Brewer, 2000).</p><p id="__p6011">COVARIATES: HIV/AIDS education, substance use score, physically forced sex, alcohol use. Potential confounding variables selected include age, gender, number of hours watching TV, feeling sadness or hopelessness, and cigarette smoking because of their documented relationships with sexual risk behavior.</p><p id="__p6012">STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Characteristics of respondents participating in the survey were compared according to race and gender using Rao-Scott &#x003c7;2 tests for categorical variables. To further assess the relationship between independent and outcome variables, all independent variables that attained a statistical significance of P&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;.25 in bivariate analyses were entered into multinomial logistic regression models in a manual stepwise fashion, starting with those with the lowest P-value. This method allows dependent variable to have more than two categories, thereby providing a single estimate of odds ratio (OR) for the association between the independent variables and each combination of the dependent variables, while controlling for potential confounders. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated and used as estimates of risk ratios. The likelihood ratio test was used to compare models to determine which variables were retained in multivariate models at a significance level &#x003b1;=.05. Age and grade level were not included in the same models because of potential collinearity. All analyses were performed with SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and the survey weight variable was used to account for the complex sampling design of the survey to provide estimates representative of the high school student population across the state.</p><p id="__p6013">RESULTS: Nearly 64% of respondents were non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics 24% while Blacks and other racial/ethnic groups represented 12%. These proportions mirror the approximate distribution of racial groups across the state. Both genders are equally represented in this sample with older adolescents (ages 15&#x02013;18 years) being the predominant group. Nearly 85% of students reported receiving voluntary in-school HIV/AIDS education. In adjusted analyses, predictors significantly associated with high risk sexual behaviors included being male, Hispanic, and having had physically forced sex. Likewise, light and binge drinking, smoking, and illegal substance use showed significant effects on sexual risk behaviors. The highest risk for early sexual debut was observed among Blacks, and Hispanics. Similarly, there was an 8-fold increase in the odds of early sexual debut among adolescents reporting physically forced sex. A dose-response relationship was observed between illegal substance use and age of sexual debut, with the strongest effect among young adolescents. Likewise, current or past smoking was associated with increased odds of early sexual debut. Statistically significant correlates of having one or more sexual partners included being Latino and high user of illegal substances, reporting forced sex, drinking alcohol, and current smoking. Associations appeared more marked among respondents using two or more drugs and having &#x02265;&#x02009;2 sexual partners.</p><p id="__p6014" class="p p-last">CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Stephen Nkansah-Amankra, PhD, MPH, MA, School of Human Sciences/Colorado School of Public Health, University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, CO, 80639, United States; snamankrasc@lycos.com</p></div></div><!--post-content--></div>\n            \n            \n        \n            \n        </div>\n        <!-- Book content -->\n    </div>\n    \n    <div id="rightcolumn" class="four_col col last">\n        <!-- Custom content above discovery portlets -->\n        <div class="col6">\n            \n        </div>\n        \n        <div xmlns:np="http://ncbi.gov/portal/XSLT/namespace" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><div class="format-menu"><h2>Formats:</h2><ul><li class="selected">Article</li> | <li><a href="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/?report=reader">PubReader</a></li> | <li class="epub-link"><a href="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/epub/">ePub (beta)</a></li> | <li><a href="/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/pdf/12529_2010_Article_9106.pdf">PDF (3.6M)</a></li> | <li><a href="#" data-citationid="PMC2816237" class="citationexporter ctxp">Citation</a></li></ul></div></div><div xmlns:np="http://ncbi.gov/portal/XSLT/namespace" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" class="share-buttons"><h2>Share</h2><ul><li class="facebook"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC2816237%2F"><img src="//static.pubmed.gov/portal/portal3rc.fcgi/4160049/img/4047626" alt="Share on Facebook" />\n                             Facebook\n                        </a></li><li class="twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC2816237%2F&amp;text=Abstracts%20from%20the%2011th%20International%20Congress%20of%20Behavioral%20Medicine"><img src="//static.pubmed.gov/portal/portal3rc.fcgi/4160049/img/4047627" alt="Share on Twitter" />\n                             Twitter\n                        </a></li><li class="gplus"><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC2816237%2F"><img src="//static.pubmed.gov/portal/portal3rc.fcgi/4160049/img/4047628" alt="Share on Google Plus" />\n                             Google+\n                        </a></li></ul></div>\n        \n        <div id="ajax-portlets" data-pmid="19856109" data-aiid="7090435" data-aid="2816237" data-iid="354737" data-domainid="3814" data-domain="phenaturepg" data-accid="PMC2816237" data-md5="6bf9db2afd0b258d13e8fa31b975b4dc"></div>\n                \n        <!-- Custom content below discovery portlets -->\n        <div class="col7">\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Custom content after all -->\n<div class="col8">\n    \n</div>\n<div class="col9">\n    \n</div>\n\n<script src="/corehtml/pmc/js/jquery.scrollTo-1.4.2.js"></script>\n<script>\n    (function($){\n        $(\'.skiplink\').each(function(i, item){\n            var href = $($(item).attr(\'href\'));\n            href.attr(\'tabindex\', \'-1\').addClass(\'skiptarget\'); // ensure the target can receive focus\n            $(item).on(\'click\', function(event){\n                event.preventDefault();\n                $.scrollTo(href, 0, {\n                    onAfter: function(){\n                        href.focus();\n                    }\n                });\n            });\n        });\n    })(jQuery);\n</script>\n\n\n\n<div id="body-link-poppers"></div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class="bottom">\n                            \n                            <div id="NCBIFooter_dynamic">\n    <a id="help-desk-link" class="help_desk" href="" target="_blank">Support Center</a>\n    <a id="help-desk-link" class="help_desk" href="https://support.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ics/support/KBList.asp?Time=2020-04-17T20:31:05-04:00&amp;Snapshot=%2Fprojects%2FPMC%2FPMCViewer@4.46&amp;Host=ptpmc101&amp;ncbi_phid=8A1AAE61E9A309510000000009C109BE&amp;ncbi_session=8A1AAE61E9A4A471_2497SID&amp;from=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC2816237%2F&amp;Db=pmc&amp;folderID=132&amp;Ncbi_App=pmc&amp;Page=literature&amp;style=classic&amp;deptID=28049" target="_blank">Support Center</a>\n    \n</div>\n\n                            <div class="footer" id="footer">\n    \n    <div class="subfooter"> </div><script type="text/javascript" src="/portal/portal3rc.fcgi/static/js/preloaderWidget.js"> </script>\n    <div id="external-disclaimer" class="offscreen_noflow">\n        External link.
