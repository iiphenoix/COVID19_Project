GIS have much more to offer than the obvious digital cartography (map) functions. From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events. Yet despite all these potentials for GIS, they remain under-utilised in the UK National Health Service (NHS). This paper has the following objectives: (1) to illustrate with practical, real-world scenarios and examples from the literature the different GIS methods and uses to improve community health and healthcare practices, e.g., for improving hospital bed availability, in community health and bioterrorism surveillance services, and in the latest SARS outbreak; (2) to discuss challenges and problems currently hindering the wide-scale adoption of GIS across the NHS; and (3) to identify the most important requirements and ingredients for addressing these challenges, and realising GIS potential within the NHS, guided by related initiatives worldwide. The ultimate goal is to illuminate the road towards implementing a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time. The concepts and principles presented in this paper can be also applied in other countries, and on regional (e.g., European Union) and global levels.</p></div></div><div id="__sec1" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="__sec1title">Introduction</h2><p id="__p2" class="p p-first">"A new wave of technological innovation is allowing us to capture, store, process and display an unprecedented amount of information about our planet and a wide variety of environmental and cultural phenomena.

The classic public health triad composed of man, agent/vehicle and environment emphasises the importance of geographic location (environment or space where we live) in health and disease. Interactions within this triad can also change with time.</p><p id="__p5">Today\'s health planners aim at developing health policy and services that address geographical and social inequalities in health, and therefore should benefit from evidence-based approaches that can be used to investigate spatial aspects of health policy and practice, and evaluate geographical equity (or inequity) in health service provision [<a href="#B3" rid="B3" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716409">3</a>].</p><p id="__p6" class="p p-last">Besides policy development, and provision and management of health services, public health practitioners have other important and related tasks including prioritisation of interventions and programmes, responding to health alerts and concerns, intersectoral engagement, and community development initiatives. In all these tasks, they should strive to incorporate searching and using best evidence in their everyday decision-making processes in order to minimise investment of efforts and funds in areas where there is solid evidence of no effect, or evidence of harm, or of poor cost-effectiveness. Evidence-based approaches can also highlight areas where the evidence may be less than reliable, requiring further assessment before expending large funds and efforts. Ideally, the tools to achieve this goal should be accessible and usable by mainstream practitioners, transparently embedded into routine workflows, and seamlessly incorporated into existing busy work environments [<a href="#B4" rid="B4" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716306">4</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec3" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec3title">On geo-information and GIS</h3><p id="__p7" class="p p-first">According to the US Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), geographic location is a key feature of 80&#x02013;90% of all government data [<a href="#B5" rid="B5" class=" bibr popnode">5</a>]. The same can be also said about government data in other countries, including data generated by the health sector in different countries. This locational or spatial reference is a "main key" in the transformation of data into information, and for linking and integrating different datasets covering same and contiguous locations [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>].</p><p id="__p8">Spatial data are a resource on a par with employees, funds, etc. Use of spatial information opens up the possibility to increase efficiency in the public and private sectors.

In the next section on "GIS methods and technologies", we cast some light on the richness of GIS toolbox, which goes far beyond the mere production of simple maps (or digital cartography). The section that comes after, titled "GIS applications in health and healthcare", examines with examples the main uses of GIS in the health sector (apart from real-time GIS applications, which are covered in a separate section near the end). We then discuss the current state of GIS affairs in the UK NHS in the section titled "On the under utilisation of geo-information and GIS in the UK NHS: problems and challenges". This is followed by a section on "Geo-information and real-time GIS infrastructure requirements" in which we review the most important technical and organisational elements that are required for a successful implementation of a national geo-information infrastructure that can also support real-time GIS applications in public health. The section that follows, titled "Problematic issues and solutions", is a direct continuation of the one preceding it, and discusses tricky issues like data confidentiality and data/analysis errors, together with solutions that can address them. We next present examples of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) at different levels of development from around the world in the section on "Existing SDIs and SDI initiatives worldwide". Then in the section on "Proactive, real-time, GIS-enabled health and environmental surveillance services", we describe a wide-scale vision for, and some early real-world applications of, real-time GIS in emergency management, and in health and environmental surveillance. Such applications currently involve limited SDI-like arrangements, and would certainly benefit from the development of mature SDIs in their respective regions.

Choropleth maps are commonly used to depict the patterns of disease rates. Disease incidence and other spatio-temporal epidemiological events are portrayed on these maps as shaded polygons (each representing an administrative area). Each of these polygons contains a numerical value of the mapped disease incidence represented as a shaded value within the covered national framework. Visual communication of disease risk is oversimplified since all values appear evenly distributed within a polygon. Moreover, values among contiguous areas (polygons) in a choropleth map can differ abruptly at adjoining borders, while in reality disease incidence and most other spatio-temporal events and phenomena such as deprivation levels are continuous variables distributed continuously across space and do not change abruptly at arbitrarily defined administrative, census and political boundaries (Figure <a href="/pmc/articles/PMC343292/figure/F1/" target="figure" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="F1" rid-ob="ob-F1" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F1"><span style="position: relative;text-decoration:none;">&#x200B;<span class="figpopup-sensitive-area" style="left: -3.5em;">(Figure1).</span></span><span>1</span></a>).

Rushton mentions three factors to explain why data is commonly made available for such odd-shaped and different sized regions: (1) data for such areas can be easily encoded from the information provided; (2) information is often requested for such areas as people are familiar with them and use them to convey the spatial limits of their interest, and also to enable comparisons between different administrative regions, e.g., regarding success in implementing a particular directive, health promotion programme or other intervention; and (3) aggregating health data to areas is one easy method to reduce the risk of disclosure and protect privacy of individuals [<a href="#B14" rid="B14" class=" bibr popnode">14</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec9" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec9title">Smoothed maps</h3><p id="__p31" class="p p-first">To meet the purpose of exploratory spatial analysis, health data are better examined by methods that assume that disease rates are spatially continuous [<a href="#B14" rid="B14" class=" bibr popnode">14</a>]. One can display data collected at smaller geographic areas (with fewer individuals) and still maintain the stability of the estimated rates by constructing a smoothed map. One way to do this is to use Bayesian or empirical Bayes methods, calculating the estimated rates for each smaller area by incorporating information about the observed data from neighbouring areas together with priors concerning the spatial variation of the rates [<a href="#B17" rid="B17" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716436">17</a>].</p><p id="__p32">Another approach is to use a spatial filter or ratio smoother [<a href="#B17" rid="B17" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716302">17</a>]. The principal reason to filter disease data spatially is to examine the spatial pattern of disease at different levels of spatial resolution and to compute disease rates that are not dependent on the specific boundaries of the areas used in spatially aggregated data [<a href="#B14" rid="B14" class=" bibr popnode">14</a>]. A spatial filter can be applied to individual point data, as well as to data aggregated into small census areas. In its simplest form, the estimated rate at a particular location, or grid point, is defined as the observed rate within a fixed distance from the grid point. The circles of neighbouring grid points are set to overlap to allow neighbouring grid points to share observations. After assigning estimated rates to each grid point, contouring software is used to create isarithmic maps in which regions with a constant range of values can be recognised. This enables the creation of a continuous smoothed map of the data [<a href="#B17" rid="B17" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716368">17</a>].</p><p id="__p33">Talbot et al propose a modified spatial filter for creating smoothed disease maps, where the spatial filter is defined in terms of constant or near constant population size rather than constant geographic size. This means that the circles will usually be larger in the rural areas (lower population density) compared to urban areas (higher population density) [<a href="#B17" rid="B17" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716355">17</a>].</p><p id="__p34">Kriging can be also used to produce continuous map surfaces from sample points. Croner and Cola provide some good examples from the literature of using the geostatistical procedure of kriging in disease epidemiology and public health. They also describe their own experience in using the procedure to model and forecast the underlying spatial structure of reported Lyme disease incidence in the US. Kriged smoothed maps may strengthen our ability to visually communicate event patterns, especially over time (also possibly through the combined use of kriging and animation). As a geostatistical modelling technique, kriging takes into account the existing underlying spatial structure of georeferenced information (distances among samples or observations). Statistically optimal estimates and their standard errors for locations with missing data (unsampled locations) may be derived, and the actual and estimated data represented together as a smoothed surface or raster data structure. Kriging can also take into consideration associative covariates when producing the final smoothed surface. However, the accuracy of kriging results depends on the aggregation level of the data used (e.g., state-level vs. finer county-level data in the US) [<a href="#B16" rid="B16" class=" bibr popnode">16</a>].</p><p id="__p35">Trend surface analysis is another technique for producing smoothed maps. Trend surface maps are commonly used to report the spatial diffusion process of disease epidemics (the movement of epidemics across geographical space). In their GIS-driven Drug Incidence and Prevalence Estimation Program (DIPEP), Field et al used trend surface maps to overcome the drawbacks of administrative boundary choropleth maps (e.g., ward-based maps in the UK). They also used animated sequences of trend surface maps to study the waves of diffusion of problematic drug misuse across time. Animated trend surface maps could be considered as illustrating a more accurate picture of the spatio-temporal characteristics of mapped events and phenomena, when compared to administrative boundary maps, since populations are distributed continuously across space [<a href="#B18" rid="B18" class=" bibr popnode">18</a>].</p><p id="__p36" class="p p-last">It is noteworthy that the interpolation tools in ESRI ArcGIS 3D Analyst, Spatial Analyst, and Geostatistical Analyst extensions support kriging among other methods for the production of continuous surfaces from sampled points, while ESRI ArcGIS Tracking Analyst extension enables the visualisation and analysis of temporal data (including real-time data feeds) by defining events including time, location, and attribute information.

It includes a range of parameters to model drug misuse and its geographic spread across a population using UK data as a basis for developing a European-wide forecasting system.

For such applications to be truly integrated into the strategic decision-making process, they should incorporate task-appropriate statistical and modelling techniques, e.g., spatial interaction models (allowing proposed health services/centres to be added interactively to assess their impact), and location-allocation models in order to forecast and evaluate the implication of modifying the configuration of existing services (i.e., "what if" scenarios), and thus play a proactive role in the healthcare planning process. GIS have been used in a number of studies to estimate the best/optimal location for a new clinic, hospital or GP surgery to minimise distances potential patients need to travel taking into account existing facilities, transport provision, hourly variations in traffic volumes, and population density. A number of these studies using the networking capabilities of GIS have been concerned with the concept of potential accessibility. Others, who have had access to spatially disaggregated data, have been concerned with (actual) revealed accessibility patterns of service utilisation [<a href="#B28" rid="B28" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716416">28</a>].</p><p id="__p63">Another remarkable application involves the use of GIS to improve hospital bed availability and avoid access block. Access block (hospital bed shortage) occurs when a patient in the emergency department (ED) requiring inpatient care is unable to gain access to an appropriate bed within a reasonable time. It is measured by the percentage of all patients admitted, transferred to another hospital for admission, or dying in the ED whose total ED time exceeds eight hours. Access block is the prime symptom of supply/demand mismatch in hospital bed stock in Australia. This is also true in many other parts of the world today, including the UK. Access block may result in ambulance bypass, increased ED waiting time and casualty queues, increased frequency of adverse events, increased patient complaints, and adverse media attention. Ashby describes a number of ameliorating strategies to avoid access block that have been implemented by the Royal Brisbane Hospital in Queensland, Australia where he works as Executive Director of Medical Services. Among these strategies is a method to improve hospital bed availability through precision bed management using integrated demand, utilisation and PAS (Patient Administration System) data, flow models and advanced GIS to map the geography of the hospital against variables such as patient numbers, staff numbers, and nurse dependency. GIS are used in patient flow modelling to look firstly at opportunities for flow reversal of ED, outpatients and secondary level inpatients, and secondly to improve efficiency through optimum distribution of patients according to a number of variables including nurse dependency, projected length of stay, projected time of discharge and infection status. GIS are proving superior to conventional patient activity systems in informing the organisation about bed management opportunities on an hour-by-hour basis [<a href="#B32" rid="B32" class=" bibr popnode">32</a>,<a href="#B33" rid="B33" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716332">33</a>].</p><p id="__p64" class="p p-last">It is noteworthy that Downey Regional Medical Centre (DRMC) in California, US, is currently using a large, multi-layered, GIS-enabled patient care and room management system that leverages digital floor plans, workflow analysis, and data visualisation for a better solution to how DRMC assigns patients to rooms, monitors the discharge process, and prepares rooms for new patients.

GIS have been used in the UK health sector for over a decade, but their greatest contribution so far has been in low-level operational tasks (see "surveys of levels of GIS use in the NHS" below).

As outlined in this key strategy document, data-rich records kept by GPs remain a relatively untapped resource particularly in the areas of local health surveillance, service audit and resource targeting. Information for Health also calls for data sharing between NHS and non-NHS organisations in order to tackle health issues. Linkages between, for example, poor health and unemployment, housing, crime, and education are major drivers for partnership approaches between such organisations. The Acheson Report published in 1998 also recognised the need to adopt cross-governmental approaches to address health concerns [<a href="#B37" rid="B37" class=" bibr popnode">37</a>]. Considering all of this, and given the recent media attention to geographical variations in healthcare service provision, which often revolve around the so-called "postcode lottery" in treatment levels, the fact that a considerable majority of the datasets used in UK primary and secondary care are geo-referenced, and the recent increase in the number of articles (e.g., [<a href="#B10" rid="B10" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716405">10</a>]), books (e.g., [<a href="#B38" rid="B38" class=" bibr popnode">38</a>-<a href="#B41" rid="B41" class=" bibr popnode">41</a>]), and conferences (e.g., [<a href="#B42" rid="B42" class=" bibr popnode">42</a>]) about the potentials and use of GIS in health applications, it is surprising there has been no mention in Information for Health or other more recent follow-up documents (e.g., "Building the Information Core: Implementing the NHS Plan" published in 2001 &#x02013; [<a href="#B43" rid="B43" class=" bibr popnode">43</a>]) of the role that spatial data and GIS could play in the new NHS [<a href="#B28" rid="B28" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716359">28</a>,<a href="#B35" rid="B35" class=" bibr popnode">35</a>].</p><p id="__p67">The role of spatial information in the health sector in relation to, for example, local health improvement programmes or performance management is not identified in any of the core UK national strategy and policy documents, although the potential for using information from primary care systems to support needs assessment and resource targeting is one of the principal action points.

This was attributed to a lack of spatial data-handling skills within the NHS and the failure to realise the value of geographical information, which was often being collected as part of existing operational tasks. Cummins and Rathwell also found that there was little in the way of infrastructure to enable staff, training, resource management, and financial budgets to implement GIS. The small size of many IT departments and high staff turnover, attributed to the higher wage levels of staff with spatial handling skills in the private sector, also hindered the effective implementation of GIS.</p><p id="__p74">Gould (1992 &#x02013; cited in [<a href="#B28" rid="B28" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716426">28</a>,<a href="#B35" rid="B35" class=" bibr popnode">35</a>]) found high levels of GIS awareness by Directors of Public Health and health authority information/IT officers in England and Wales, though respondents did not perceive any differences between GIS and computer assisted cartography software, and were not really using the software in anything more than simple mapping and low-level operational tasks. Typically, maps were being included in the annual reports of the Directors of Public Health to illustrate the health priorities of individual health authorities, with very little emphasis on using GIS in strategic tasks. Gould drew attention to a number of factors limiting the use of GIS for strategic tasks within the NHS, such as a low skills base in the handling of spatial information and the lack of functions for spatial analysis and spatial modelling in commercial packages (at that time; this is only marginally true in today\'s GIS packages).</p><p id="__p75">These findings were replicated in a study conducted in the later part of the 1990s by Smith and Jarvis (1998 &#x02013; cited in [<a href="#B28" rid="B28" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716341">28</a>,<a href="#B35" rid="B35" class=" bibr popnode">35</a>]). Smith and Jarvis surveyed changes in the use of GIS within the NHS following the reforms of the early 1990s and found that GIS use has again tended to be uncoordinated and low-level in nature, because of a lack of policy directives concerning appropriate systems, as well as a general lack of high quality data. Moreover, they noted a particular lack of collaboration between GIS academics and healthcare practitioners/managers. Research undertaken in academia has certainly highlighted the benefits of spatial statistics and GIS approaches in mapping disease and in healthcare planning, but still needs to respond to NHS needs on the ground.</p><p id="__p76">One area where GIS have debatably made less impact is that of measuring and monitoring NHS performance. A number of dimensions could be measured such as improving the health of the general population, ensuring fair access to services, maintaining the effective delivery of appropriate care and analysing the outcomes of NHS care. GIS have a potential role in evaluating performance and could be used to enable comparisons to be made between health authorities and NHS trusts. GIS are being used by a relatively small number of authorities to assess the effectiveness and impact of health interventions and health education campaigns [<a href="#B28" rid="B28" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716326">28</a>].</p><p id="__p77" class="p p-last">More recently, Cooper (2000) surveyed thirteen health authorities in the West Midlands. Two thirds of the surveyed health authorities stated that GIS was being under-utilised and cited the main reasons as the high costs of digital geographical data and the lack of resources for training and work-time constraints for NHS personnel, because of the low priority given to GIS within the organisations by senior management. Staff turnover, especially in organisations where only one member of staff is responsible for GIS work (this was the case in 30% of surveyed organisations), left such organisations vulnerable in terms of their GIS capabilities. Cooper advocates the setting up of regional health GIS centres, integrated with the newly formed public health observatories to provide GIS support for local health services and to coordinate training programmes to improve the GIS skills base. These regional services could be responsible for coordinating data collection at the regional level, and preventing any duplication of efforts in spatial data collection or processing [<a href="#B50" rid="B50" class=" bibr popnode">50</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec20" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec20title">Public health observatories</h3><p id="__p78" class="p p-first">Public health observatories (PHOs), as proposed in the government White Paper "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation" [<a href="#B51" rid="B51" class=" bibr popnode">51</a>], have been set up in each NHS region to draw information together from a range of sources with which to monitor health trends and to identify gaps in information [<a href="#B10" rid="B10" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716383">10</a>].

However, only 54% of health authorities and 56% of health trusts within this active subset reported having fully operational GIS. Trusts using GIS include ambulance services NHS trusts that are using GIS in real-time emergency service despatching and control, and cancer intelligence units that are using GIS to examine spatial patterns of disease incidence.

In health trusts, the dominant reported use of GIS was for targeting resources towards local population groups. Using GIS in monitoring performance was undertaken in 30% of health authorities and 39% of health trusts in the active subset. Internet and Intranet GIS were found to be still rare within the NHS [<a href="#B35" rid="B35" class=" bibr popnode">35</a>].</p><p id="__p84">Higgs et al also attempted to measure the levels of joined-up working within NHS organisations and with external agencies (e.g., Police, local authorities, utilities, and other central government departments), which has the potential to address a wider range of cross departmental or governmental issues (e.g., health, poverty and social exclusion). They found limited exchange of data between health trusts and other organisations. By contrast, a more significant number of health authorities were reported exchanging data with external organisations, with significant collaboration with local authorities in over 30% of cases in the active subset (still not a very high figure) [<a href="#B35" rid="B35" class=" bibr popnode">35</a>].</p><p id="__p85">Despite these uses of GIS in operational and policy-related tasks, many respondents identified factors they perceived to be hindering the wider use of GIS within their organisation, and data exchange and collaboration with other organisations and local authorities. These obstacles included work-time constraints, insufficient staff and financial resources to implement systems fully and undertake data exchange duties with other organisations (e.g., establishing networks and contacts), lack of skills and insufficient training or guidance, lack of digital data in appropriate formats and problems of ensuring data quality, data confidentiality issues, lack of demand from within some organisations to the use of GIS (directors are not aware of value of GIS rather than not committed to GIS), and lack of a clear GIS strategy [<a href="#B35" rid="B35" class=" bibr popnode">35</a>].</p><p id="__p86">The lack of a clear organisational policy for exchanging data was among the most significant data exchange constraints identified by health authorities and trusts.

We then present a Canadian case study that emphasises the importance of data modelling and community/university collaboration among other elements involved in the development of community health geo-information systems. The reader will notice that there are many recurring themes, and elements and ingredients which are common to all these recipes and the presented case study. The section concludes with a detailed discussion of some of these elements and others that are crucial for properly building a national spatial health information infrastructure.</p><div id="__sec23" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec23title">The Nairobi statement &#x02013; International Federation of Surveyors and the United Nations-Habitat, 2002</h3><p id="__p90" class="p p-first">The International Conference on Spatial Information for Sustainable Development held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2001 recognised that development and implementation of a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) is a prerequisite for promoting sustainable development in any country. The conference also recognised that although every NSDI is different due to a variety of cultural, social and economic factors unique within each country, there are a significant number of common elements that can be shared, and which countries should avoid re-inventing; these elements include [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>]:</p><p id="__p91">(1) Fostering a culture of data sharing that considers spatial information an asset: A key success factor of NSDI implementation is the management of information (including spatial information) as an asset, e.g., only capture data that are needed and can be maintained, as in the case with finance and human resources. A NSDI requires a culture of data sharing to exist within a country. The benefits associated with data sharing should be researched to encourage wide participation [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>].</p><p id="__p92">(2) Education, training, and capacity building: The sharing of education and training resources and experiences by organisations is important for capacity building. Universities should be encouraged to work with local organisations in the provision of Continuing Professional Development [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>]. (Of interest in this context is UNIGIS International <a href="http://www.unigis.org/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.unigis.org/</a>, a worldwide network of educational institutions offering distance-learning courses in GIS.)</p><p id="__p93">(3) Addressing crucial legal issues: Experience has shown that issues associated with national security, data privacy and associated liability are potential obstacles for NSDI initiatives. Unambiguous legal frameworks to address these crucial legal issues must be established as early as possible. Ordinary citizens must be considered one of the main NSDI beneficiaries and allowed access to NSDI information and services (where appropriate) [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>].</p><p id="__p94">(4) Development of effective partnerships, and involvement of all stakeholders and users: Mature NSDIs are complex solutions involving many stakeholders (including the health sector with all its organisations). NSDIs are underpinned by effective partnerships and cooperation amongst a wide variety of multi-disciplinary stakeholders in the public and private sectors and end-user communities. Appropriate business models must be agreed to support these partnerships at an early stage. The success of a NSDI depends upon delivering products and services that are acceptable and desired by end users (within the government and the private sector, and also citizens). It is essential that all users are involved when defining (user) requirements and testing the associated products and services. NSDI policy must be flexible to address rapidly changing user needs and adapt to changing technologies. NSDI Steering Groups (with end-user representation) should be formed to formulate appropriate policy and institutional frameworks and facilitate multi-stakeholder cooperation. However, complete policy and institutional frameworks need not be in place before implementation of a NSDI can begin. Roles and responsibilities among stakeholders must be clarified at an early stage, including the lead role &#x02013; this should be an initial activity of a NSDI Steering Group [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>].</p><p id="__p95">(5) Adopting common standards and data models: ISO <a href="http://www.iso.org/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.iso.org/</a> and the Open GIS Consortium <a href="http://www.opengis.org/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.opengis.org/</a> produce data and interoperability standards that should be adopted by NSDI stakeholders (see later). To be able to integrate and share data we need to understand and resolve different semantics in data. All NSDI datasets from different sources should adopt the same overarching philosophy and same/compatible data models to achieve multi-purpose data integration, both vertically and horizontally (within organisations, and across organisations and different administrative levels) [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>].</p><p id="__p96">(6) A combined top-down and bottom-up incremental implementation approach: It is recommended that a top down approach is combined with a pragmatic bottom up approach. A mature NSDI can only be achieved through simpler and smaller solutions that start with realistic and clear short-term objectives, and grow incrementally through political and market needs. Short-term bottom up projects will provide valuable experience that can feed into the formulation of NSDI policy and strategy. By creating "proof of concept and benefits applications", these projects can be also used to gain and sustain political support, and convince further funding of NSDI [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>].</p><p id="__p97" class="p p-last">(7) Do not just focus on data; develop applications: Varied applications and services through a project-oriented approach will bring reality to the NSDI. An overemphasis on data acquisition, without a market-linked application, will not provide any momentum for further development. Visualisation, modelling and analysing activities will be the focus of value-added services in the coming years [<a href="#B6" rid="B6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec24" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec24title">EIS-AFRICA &#x02013; Gavin et al, 2002</h3><p id="__p98" class="p p-first">EIS-AFRICA is a network for the cooperative management of environmental information in Africa. It is a pan-African, non-profit, non-governmental organisation, registered in South Africa, and born out of the World Bank\'s Environmental Information Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa programme (EIS-SSA). Building infrastructure for geo-information use is becoming as important to African countries as the building of roads and telecommunication networks. As with the investment in other basic infrastructures, investing in a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) underpins the provision of many essential services. In a recent EIS-AFRICA position paper published in 2002, Gavin et al describe the following SDI components [<a href="#B9" rid="B9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>]:</p><p id="__p99">(1) Up-to-date core digital geo-datasets: A country\'s ability to use geo-information effectively depends on the existence and proper investment into the provision and maintenance of up-to-date core digital geo-datasets, e.g., locations of river networks, roads, land cover, administrative boundaries, and populated places. The existence of these commonly used datasets facilitates the use of other geodata, such as demographic, socio-economic, epidemiological, environmental, and water quality data, which must be also available, accessible and up-to-date [<a href="#B9" rid="B9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>].</p><p id="__p100">(2) Standards: Geodata must adhere to accepted standards to enable the unambiguous interpretation, integration, and comparison of related datasets from different sources. Stakeholders should work together locally and with international bodies to develop/adopt standards for geodata collection and documentation [<a href="#B9" rid="B9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>]. (Adopting international standards will also ensure that future collaboration is possible at regional and global levels.)</p><p id="__p101">(3) Metadata: The accessibility of proper documentation (metadata) about existing geodata is also extremely important. The mere existence of geodata is not sufficient. Information about datasets is needed for the purposes of generating awareness of the data\'s existence among potential users, and for helping these users assess the reliability and/or relevance of available datasets for selected uses. This in turn requires that data providers publicise their metadata to the public and targeted users in a suitable catalogue, directory or clearinghouse to enable searching and retrieving documentation on available datasets. Metadata, too, should be standardised [<a href="#B9" rid="B9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>] (Figure <a href="/pmc/articles/PMC343292/figure/F3/" target="figure" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="F3" rid-ob="ob-F3" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F3"><span style="position: relative;text-decoration:none;">&#x200B;<span class="figpopup-sensitive-area" style="left: -3.5em;">(Figure3</span></span><span>3</span></a>).</p><!--fig ft0--><!--fig mode=article f1--><div class="fig iconblock whole_rhythm clearfix" id="F3" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F3"><a href="/pmc/articles/PMC343292/figure/F3/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F3" rid-ob="ob-F3"><!--fig/graphic|fig/alternatives/graphic mode="anchored" m1--><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140527931926736" class="figure"><img class="fig-image" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 1476-072X-3-1-3.jpg" title="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.&#10;Object name is 1476-072X-3-1-3.jpg" src="/pmc/articles/PMC343292/bin/1476-072X-3-1-3.jpg" /></div><div id="largeobj_idm140527931926736" class="largeobj-link align_right" style="display: none"><a target="object" href="/pmc/articles/PMC343292/figure/F3/?report=objectonly">Open in a separate window</a></div></a><div class="icnblk_cntnt" id="lgnd_F3"><div><a class="figpopup" href="/pmc/articles/PMC343292/figure/F3/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F3" rid-ob="ob-F3">Figure 3</a></div><!--caption a7--><div class="caption"><p id="__p102"><strong>Screenshot of ArcCatalog, part of ArcGIS Desktop 8.3 from ESRI </strong>Screenshot of ArcCatalog and the built-in ISO Metadata Wizard/editor (part of ArcGIS Desktop 8.3 from ESRI).

Policies should start by removing barriers to access, e.g., excessive costs to use an information product or lack of clarity concerning copyright. The absence of a policy concerning data access and sharing can often be as handicapping as the presence of an inhibiting policy. Existing policies need to be revised and new policies developed as necessary. Broad-based national committees of data producers, users, and other stakeholders should be created to oversee the development of geo-information policy and standards and ensure compliance [<a href="#B9" rid="B9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>].</p><p id="__p104">(5) Appropriate human and other resources: Sufficient human and technical resources are required to collect, manipulate, interpret, and distribute geo-information. Without appropriate human resources, geo-information will remain unexploited. Sufficient financial resources must be available to invest in training people. Retaining technical expertise should be also a priority within institutions using geo-information. Adequate investments must be also made in technologies for digital data management and storage, and in improving communications infrastructure [<a href="#B9" rid="B9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>].</p><p id="__p105">(6) Coordination between various stakeholders: The cost-effective development of SDI requires the coordinated harnessing of resources and expertise in many different government agencies, the private sector, universities, non-governmental organisations, and regional and international bodies. Collaborative frameworks (partnerships) are required to prevent duplication of effort (which would occur if various institutions pursue singular, uncoordinated agendas), and ensure that all captured and generated data and information conform to common standards, so that they can be easily combined and effectively analysed. Such frameworks should specify which organisations are gathering which kinds of information, how the information will be captured, and arrangements for data sharing [<a href="#B9" rid="B9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>].</p><p id="__p106" class="p p-last">(7) Raising awareness: Establishing a formal national programme can help heighten awareness and generate support.

Buckeridge and his colleagues present their experience in conducting a collaborative community/university respiratory health GIS research project in Canada. Their experience is a good example of research into the kind of partnerships (community/academia) that are also required to realise the envisaged national spatial health information infrastructure in the UK. Their specific project objectives were to: (1) develop and iteratively refine via active community/university collaboration a GIS for ready access to routinely collected health data (focusing on respiratory health), and to study logistical, conceptual and technical problems encountered during system development; and (2) to conduct a qualitative ethnographic study to document and analyse issues that can emerge in the process of community/university research collaboration [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716369">8</a>].</p><p id="__p144">Buckeridge et al adopted user-centred and rapid prototyping/iterative design methods.

The data model described by Buckeridge et al was based on a "determinants of health" model that explicitly acknowledges the influence of non-medical determinants (e.g., income, occupation, and environment) on population health status, and qualitatively relates these determinants to health outcomes [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716421">8</a>]. Such models have been used successfully as the basis for other population health information system approaches, e.g., POPULIS (see "Caring for population demographics and socio-economic factors" below) [<a href="#B59" rid="B59" class=" bibr popnode">59</a>,<a href="#B60" rid="B60" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716387">60</a>].</p><p id="__p146">The next steps involved identifying, evaluating, and acquiring potentially relevant datasets based on data needs identified from the data model. Data describing determinants of respiratory health included census, cartographic files, land use, traffic volume, air monitoring and emissions, and consumer spending patterns. Data describing outcomes of respiratory health included hospital separations (similar to Hospital Episode Statistics in England &#x02013; see <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/hes/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.doh.gov.uk/hes/</a>), ambulatory physician visits and procedures, and prescription drug sales. Once data were acquired, they were integrated into the GIS using the developed data model and the spatial unit of the enumeration area, a Canadian census sampling area with a median population of 400 in the study area (Southeast Toronto) to relate datasets to one another (in this case the enumeration area acted as a common high resolution geographical unit for linkage &#x02013; the data model facilitated data integration around the common geographical unit of the enumeration area). The limited and inconsistent descriptions (metadata) of existing data were partially addressed by adopting a "standard" <em>ad hoc </em>metadata model within the system to represent available descriptions in an organised manner [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716424">8</a>].</p><p id="__p147">Buckeridge et al highlighted some important issues they have encountered during the development of their system, and which are also generalizable to other community health information systems [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716397">8</a>]:</p><p id="__p148">(1) Early and continued involvement of users in system development is important, if not essential. However, maintaining and coordinating consistent user involvement, especially across a number of organisations, is a difficult and resource-intensive task that should be well planned [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716300">8</a>].</p><p id="__p149">(2) All relevant system stakeholders should be involved in the development of a data model or ontology to facilitate data selection and integration, and support a common understanding of data by people [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716428">8</a>].</p><p id="__p150">(3) Challenges met while bringing disparate data together included lack of directories or catalogues for locating existing data, generally poor descriptions (metadata) for existing data, non-standard encoding of data, and concern over data "ownership" and/or privacy issues. Web accessible directories of data would greatly facilitate identifying data sources. In addition, action should be taken to improve data documentation (metadata), develop data standards, and enhance compliance with existing standards. Many data holders did not have an established protocol for access to their data, or a clearly identified person with the authority to release data. In the absence of these, data holders were reluctant to release data, and acquisition of some data required a considerable amount of negotiation and follow-up. The difficulties encountered in acquiring data indicate that privacy concerns present a serious barrier to system development. A wide range of stakeholders in society must collectively address the issues of privacy and stewardship of population health data [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716357">8</a>].</p><p id="__p151">(4) The potential for data display to be misleading and for misinterpretation of data was addressed by providing users with descriptions (metadata) of datasets and constraining map types by data types. Methods to allow only valid visualisation and analysis of data from a variety of sources across space and time must be developed and evaluated [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716360">8</a>].</p><p id="__p152">(5) Problems from an interface design perspective included the need to constantly change the interface to accommodate a refined understanding of user needs and changes in the underlying data structure (because of the iterative nature of the development process).

The range of user skills and knowledge was partially addressed by developing a graphical user interface with multiple levels, each supporting a different user level. Another approach would be to use artificial intelligence, as employed in decision support systems, to facilitate user control of information visualisation [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716431">8</a>].</p><p id="__p154">(7) Community/university collaboration issues: As organisations and individuals are brought together to form research partnerships, differences in their organisational/institutional cultures become apparent. Community partners tend to see potential conflicts between service provision and research demands, while university partners tend to see the collaboration as posing threats to research rigor, control over the research process and constraints on publication opportunities [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716329">8</a>].</p><p id="__p155">Leadership style, vision, commitment to the idea of community/university collaboration, at least small amounts of "seed funding", and the willingness to learn from failures all appear to be significant features in successful collaborations. Issues that shaped and influenced the collaborative process and partnership that developed during the course of Buckeridge et al\'s project revolved around three major themes: separate cultures (differences in expectations, values, outcomes, reward systems and work styles), time, and uncertainty/ambiguity. These issues are neither positive nor negative. Rather, they represent challenges which, depending on how they are met, have the potential to shape the collaborative process in either positive or negative ways [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716420">8</a>].</p><p id="__p156">Sub-themes within the "separate cultures" category included issues around language, trust, and power. Language differences (different knowledge backgrounds and ways of understanding the world) occurred as frequently between university partners from different academic disciplines as between university and community partners. Trust developed gradually with time, as co-investigators came to recognise the strengths, commitment and knowledge of each other, and as the group worked to make joint decisions and solve conflicts. Issues of power arose from differences in status, resources, skills, and personal commitment to the project [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716304">8</a>].</p><p id="__p157">Time was a burden for individuals, but an asset to the collaborative project as a whole, as it supported the development of trust, mutual understanding and effective working relationships [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716363">8</a>].</p><p id="__p158">Many co-investigators pointed out that the most difficult aspect of their collaboration was to learn to accept and work with the uncertainty and ambiguity about where the project was going as it developed and unfolded (despite clear project goals and objectives). Nevertheless, uncertainty and ambiguity were found to be essential to the shared positive experience of exploration, debate, and reflection, and also created the space to ask critical questions [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716384">8</a>].</p><p id="__p159" class="p p-last">Community partners engaged in collaborative research with universities should see themselves as equal partners. This could be achieved in part by making an organisational commitment to research (e.g., supporting staff involved in research and advocating with funding agencies for research resources). On the other hand, universities should foster community/university research partnerships by developing university structures that support such collaboration, and inducing positive changes in the current academic culture, which places more value on individual rather than collaborative research [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716392">8</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec33" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec33title">On partnerships</h3><p id="__p160" class="p p-first">In the case study presented above, Buckeridge et al stressed the importance of community/university collaboration when developing a community health geo-information service [<a href="#B8" rid="B8" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716334">8</a>]. Public health also needs to be an integral part of a larger structural, multi-agency whole, where government and other relevant agencies at all levels are brought together to build, integrate, leverage through sharing and partnerships, and optimise spatial information, both vertically within and horizontally across organisations, for comprehensive routine as well as emergency planning and response services.

WME is designed to provide public accessibility to a wide range of federal, state, and local geospatial data about environmental conditions and features in any US location. The data available in the WME application are distributed and reside at their respective agency servers. Thus each participating agency manages its own data and its timeliness, which can be current and even real-time. There is no limit on the number of WME partners.

Doing so requires consensus on a range of technical, GIS-related issues and public health-related issues. The latter for example include case definitions, sources for case reports, and the time period for the study [<a href="#B7" rid="B7" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716429">7</a>].</p><p id="__p165">In his report commissioned by WHO-AFRO, Briggs classifies environmental health hazards into eight categories: land/climate-related hazards, atmospheric hazards (outdoor air pollution), water-related hazards, food-borne hazards, vector-borne hazards, domestic hazards, occupational hazards, and infrastructural hazards. Briggs\' report stresses the importance of indicators as essential tools for environmental health hazard mapping. Indicators provide the means of describing, monitoring, managing, and comparing hazards in terms that are relevant to information users. Three types of indicator are proposed [<a href="#B54" rid="B54" class=" bibr popnode">54</a>]:</p><p id="__p166">(1) Hazard indicators: define the hazard in terms of its extent, magnitude, duration, frequency or probability of occurrence, without reference either to the exposed population or health effect;</p><p id="__p167">(2) Risk indicators: describe the hazard in terms of the number or percentage of people exposed; and</p><p id="__p168">(3) Health impact indicators: describe the hazard in terms of the actual health outcome, measured as either morbidity or mortality [<a href="#B54" rid="B54" class=" bibr popnode">54</a>].</p><p id="__p169">Which type of indicator is most appropriate is likely to depend on the specific question being asked. Natural hazards, for example, can be readily described by hazard indicators, while hazards like suicides and domestic violence are more easily described by health impact indicators [<a href="#B54" rid="B54" class=" bibr popnode">54</a>].</p><p id="__p170">Unfortunately, there are no one-size-fits-all indicators that suit all users. Indicators need to be customised according to specific and local user circumstances and needs, the specific hazard of interest, the type of question being asked, the scale of analysis, and data availability and quality. For this reason, the emphasis in Briggs report was not on providing a core or generic set of environmental health hazard indicators, but on providing indicator profiles that show, for a sample of indicators, how they can be constructed/customised and used [<a href="#B54" rid="B54" class=" bibr popnode">54</a>].</p><p id="__p171">An indicator profile specifies the environmental health hazard(s) to which the indicator relates, the indicator\'s rationale and role, any alternative methods and definitions, any related indicator sets, sources of further information, and a listing of involved agencies. Each indicator must be clearly defined alongside all underlying terms and concepts involved in describing and constructing it. Data needed to construct an indicator must be identified and assessed regarding availability, quality, and characteristics in terms of the indicator in question. The ways in which the indicator is computed (e.g., a mathematical formula) and units of measurements used in presenting it (e.g., percentage or number per thousand head of population) must be also specified. The area across which the indicator can be used (scale of application or aggregation level) must be determined. Finally, the ways in which the indicator may be interpreted in relation to the hazard(s) it covers must be described. This includes determining what inferences can be made from apparent trends or patterns in the indicator, and any constraints on the interpretation of the indicator, due for example to data limitations or complexities in the relationships implied by the indicator [<a href="#B54" rid="B54" class=" bibr popnode">54</a>,<a href="#B62" rid="B62" class=" bibr popnode">62</a>].</p><p id="__p172">Indicators are not limited to environmental health hazard mapping. In 2000, the US National Association of County and City Health Officials &#x02013; NACCHO has produced a comprehensive list of core and extended health indicators as part of their Community Health Status Assessment (CHSA) Toolbox.

These include vaccine-preventable illness, avoidable hospitalisations (those patients admitted to the hospital in advanced stages of disease which potentially could have been detected or treated earlier), late stage cancer diagnosis, and unexpected syndromes or infections. Sentinel events may alert the community to health system problems such as inadequate vaccine coverage or lack of primary care and/or screening, a bioterrorist event, or the introduction of globally transmitted infections [<a href="#B63" rid="B63" class=" bibr popnode">63</a>].</p><p id="__p177">The CDC National Public Health Performance Standards Programme (NPHPSP &#x02013; <a href="http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/nphpsp/index.asp" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/nphpsp/index.asp</a>) is a more current partnership effort to improve the practice of public health, the performance of public health systems, and the infrastructure supporting public health actions in the US.

For instance, if a disaster hits at the border of two cities or two EU countries, will their two information silos be able to work together, sharing and combining data instantaneously? Today, many systems are based on closed or proprietary interfaces and formats, and are difficult to integrate with brands and platforms in use by other organisations.

Industry professionals now manage very large spatial databases. Often, client programs will pull a copy of the database spatial data into their own environment to process it instead of asking the database to do the processing. If the client program request happens to involve a very large database table, the copy-and-exchange process may drag on endlessly or even fail because of overload. This same potential problem awaits users of multiple feature-streaming map services [<a href="#B67" rid="B67" class=" bibr popnode">67</a>].</p><p id="__p201">Alternatively, if the spatial processing remains within the database environment, an optimiser program common to all professional databases will internally organise a response to the query that returns results in the fastest possible time. A query from the larger integrated system goes into the database and only the results come out, taking advantage of the database optimiser, reducing processing loads on the client that generated the question, and also reducing transmission loads [<a href="#B67" rid="B67" class=" bibr popnode">67</a>].</p><p id="__p202">Each database vendor\'s optimiser works best within its own specific database environment. A potential problem arises in case one wants to optimise the use of multiple databases when a query joins data from several different databases (from different vendors) at the same time. In the same spirit as the Web Services model, agencies can keep their existing heterogeneous database technology, and use a federated database technology to unite the mix. IBM, for example, offers a federated database technology that simulates views of any other database tables in IBM DB2 database, offering a master view of all data holdings. Furthermore, the federated technology\'s optimiser is aware of the available processing resources in other databases and organises query responses appropriately [<a href="#B67" rid="B67" class=" bibr popnode">67</a>,<a href="#B74" rid="B74" class=" bibr popnode">74</a>].</p><p id="__p203" class="p p-last">Grid-based real-time distributed collaborative geoprocessing could also form the basis of a next-generation solution to data and computationally intensive geoprocessing applications that are extremely difficult to execute on conventional systems and networks [<a href="#B75" rid="B75" class=" bibr popnode">75</a>].

New York City is now building automated conflation capability by modifying all city planning spatial databases to include standardised "hooks" for matching and seamless linkage [<a href="#B58" rid="B58" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716345">58</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec39" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec39title">Adequate telecommunications infrastructure and bandwidth for spatial data transmission</h3><p id="__p207" class="p p-first-last">For public health, a variety of rapid developing emergency-related events, including floods, fires, chemical spills and earthquakes, necessitate timely Web delivery of large spatial databases for responsive disaster intervention and control. Bandwidth is not only a problem of developing countries, but developed ones as well. Again, in the emergency response to the fall 2001 terrorist attack, lack of bandwidth in some areas of New York City resulted in delays in providing processed and urgently needed data for the Emergency Mapping and Data Centre (EMDC). Because of low bandwidth Internet connections, large data files had to be written to CD-ROM and driven by state Police twice daily for delivery to the agencies that needed them. Bandwidth is a key component of the transmission process of spatial data and is rapidly increasing in developed countries, promising improved spatial data transmission speeds in the near future [<a href="#B58" rid="B58" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716417">58</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec40" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec40title">Seamless integration into routine workflows of tools that are easy-to-use by mainstream public health practitioners</h3><p id="__p208" class="p p-first">Richards et al call for GIS technology to be linked with community health planning tools through data entry forms and automated procedures (e.g., automated geocoding for vital statistics data) to help public health practitioners map and plan interventions at community level. GIS software tools are needed that are specifically custom-designed for use in public health, especially by organisations with limited staff and resources. Richards et al anticipate that GIS technology may one day become embedded and so deeply "buried" in public health practice to the extent that it is invisible to workers. Future health GIS applications will "know" which data silos are needed and where they are located. After loading the appropriate data and performing relevant analyses, they will offer alternative courses of action ranging from informing other people in the public health system to issuing health advisories [<a href="#B7" rid="B7" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716389">7</a>].</p><p id="__p209" class="p p-last">It is noteworthy that Epi Info Version 3 developed by the CDC in the US already fulfils part of this vision.

The ultimate system will be one that is fault-tolerant and capable of analysing and presenting assembled data in ways that facilitate only appropriate interpretations of integrated data. This can be achieved by using some form of user friendly, "intelligent", goal-oriented health GIS wizards (based on robust statistical methods where appropriate), so that only valid results and maps are produced, even when users attempt to select inappropriate settings or datasets for a particular analysis. To maximise their utility, these wizards should also be fully integrated into everyday public health workflows and decision-making process. Such seamless integration would let users focus and spend most of their time on what they want to achieve rather than on learning and overcoming the limitations of the tools they are supposed to use to achieve their goals.</p></div><div id="__sec41" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec41title">User interface accessibility requirements</h3><p id="__p210" class="p p-first">In the US, Internet-based health GIS services must ensure Section 508 compliance with the Rehabilitation Act Amendments <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html</a> and <a href="http://www.section508.gov/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.section508.gov/</a> to make complex graphical and mapping files accessible to visually impaired users [<a href="#B58" rid="B58" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716379">58</a>] (see also <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/section508/index.html" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.esri.com/software/section508/index.html</a>).

SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) mapping in Hong Kong using disaggregate case data at individual building level in near real time was another noticeable exception to this well-established public health confidentiality rule, and also a unique and rare GIS opportunity that resulted in some very comprehensive public Internet mapping services (see "Real-time/near-real-time GIS for epidemics management" below) [<a href="#B80" rid="B80" class=" bibr popnode">80</a>].</p><p id="__p218">Spatial data confidentiality is a complex issue. Even if a single database may appear to have effective confidentiality safeguards, when several databases are linked within GIS, the "sum" may be less well protected than the "parts". A false identification may be just as damaging to an individual as a correct identification that is not kept confidential [<a href="#B7" rid="B7" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716288">7</a>].</p><p id="__p219">On the other hand, confidentiality constraints often preclude the release of disaggregate data about individuals, which limits the types and accuracy of the results of the analyses that could be done [<a href="#B81" rid="B81" class=" bibr popnode">81</a>]. Individual agencies holding micro-data (small population/individual health and environmental data) often impose restrictions on the level of geography that can be reported. In the US, for example, the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS &#x02013; <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/</a>) requires that for all micro-data that are released outside of NCHS, geographic identification must be deleted for all areas below the State level, which contain fewer than some predetermined number of inhabitants. Traditional ecological analysis based on choropleth mapping and the analysis of aggregate data for administrative areas has been heavily criticised. It is increasingly becoming clear in the field of public health that individual-level health information aggregated to pre-existing political or other administrative areas to protect individual privacy often destroys information needed for geographical analyses making it impossible to address many important public health concerns, e.g., accident risk of particular environments, hazards of living close to hazardous waste sites, exposure risk from lead associated with urban highways, etc. Such concerns can only be addressed using micro-data. The lack of spatially-disaggregate data on healthcare utilisation and clinical activity also limits the types and power of healthcare delivery studies that can be carried [<a href="#B13" rid="B13" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716307">13</a>,<a href="#B28" rid="B28" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716419">28</a>,<a href="#B82" rid="B82" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716336">82</a>,<a href="#B83" rid="B83" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716413">83</a>].</p><p id="__p220">Using aggregated data instead of address-level data (when the latter is required) produces what Jacquez calls "spatial uncertainty". Moreover, using area centroids instead of exact locations can yield misleading results [<a href="#B12" rid="B12" class=" bibr popnode">12</a>]. According to Armstrong et al, when data are spatially aggregated to large areas, the ability of researchers to detect disease clusters or to investigate suspected relationships between environmental exposures and disease events is affected in four ways: (1) absolute and relative locations within the geographical extent of each area are unobservable making it impossible to perform tests of clustering, except for those designed to operate specifically on data aggregated to areas; (2) the effect of the geographic scale of the aggregation with respect to the geographic scale of the clusters means that the aggregation level used in an analysis limits the size of clusters that could be detected; (3) the shape and placement of aggregation areas in relation to the real-world distribution of the disease or clusters under study, e.g., when a disease cluster straddles two or more aggregation areas, may result in ambiguous or negative results; and (4) accurate analyses are only possible when health data are spatially encoded to the boundaries of areas with common levels of environmental exposure, which is usually not the case since exposure assessment data are generally collected for different areas than health and demographic data [<a href="#B83" rid="B83" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716364">83</a>].</p><p id="__p221">Fortunately, solutions exist that can preserve data confidentiality while still enabling fine-level analyses and reliable results. These solutions involve (1) the use of statistical and epidemiological methods to mask the geographic location of data in a way that can still permit meaningful analysis, e.g., special types of spatial and temporal aggregation of data; (2) the creation of secure (networked) environments with limited and multiple levels of access (to confidential data) in which public health researchers can be carefully monitored to ensure protection of individual and household confidentiality; and (3) the development, publication and strict enforcement of appropriate, unambiguous policies and regulations [<a href="#B7" rid="B7" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716351">7</a>,<a href="#B58" rid="B58" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716415">58</a>]. The three solution groups are discussed below.</p><p id="__p222">(1) Statistical and epidemiological methods: Armstrong et al describe different promising types of geographical masks to encode the geography of health records. These masks not only preserve the confidentiality of individual health records, but also preserve, to the maximum degree possible, the geographic properties of the data, thus permitting the investigation of questions that can be validly answered only with some (adequate) knowledge about the location of health events [<a href="#B83" rid="B83" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716422">83</a>].</p><p id="__p223">The geographic coordinates of data collected at discrete locations can be subjected to a family of affine point transformations that move these locations deterministically to a new set of locations. Another technique is random perturbation, in which each point is displaced (within the range of a constant maximum magnitude of displacement) by a randomly determined amount, and in a randomly determined direction, specific to its original location. A third class of geographic masks is aggregation. Areal aggregation involves enumerating the total that exists within a region. Point aggregation uses a single, surrogate location to represent the location of several individual-level events. In the latter case, regions could be represented by their geographic centroids, or surrogate locations could be computed that are optimised regarding some defined relationship to the original locations (location-allocation methods). Other point aggregation methods include microaggregation and blurring. It is also possible to aggregate for non-conterminous "regions" of interest like releasing health data for all areas within a given distance of a specified hazard, e.g., all children\'s accidents within 20 metres of stop signs. Another possible approach to limiting disclosure is to remove all explicit geographic identifiers from the health record and replace them with contextual information of specific interest to the data user [<a href="#B83" rid="B83" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716418">83</a>].</p><p id="__p224">The best approach will depend on the purpose of the data user as well as the degree of disclosure risk that the data custodian wishes to tolerate. Preliminary research suggests that random perturbation of data, up to some limit, is superior to affine and aggregation masks for many analytical purposes [<a href="#B83" rid="B83" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716327">83</a>].</p><p id="__p225">Areal aggregation is perhaps the most commonly adopted approach among those suggested by Armstrong et al [<a href="#B83" rid="B83" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716342">83</a>]. Health organisations are always looking for finer levels of boundary geography to aggregate their data to. The US South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) used to aggregate spatial health information at county level. While county-level data provide a wealth of information, information at this macro scale does not allow local health officials to adequately identify, analyse, and monitor health problems at the community level. Laymon describes SCDHEC\'s more recent approach to managing geo-referenced vital health records by geocoding them, then aggregating them at census tract level instead of county level. A US census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county designed to be relatively homogenous with respect to demographics, socio-economic characteristics, and living conditions, and to contain between 2,500 and 8,000 residents. SCDHEC chose census tracts because they contain useful socio-economic data that could be combined with the aggregated vital records. Census tracts were also chosen because these geographic boundaries are updated once every decade (stable) [<a href="#B84" rid="B84" class=" bibr popnode">84</a>].</p><p id="__p226">The resultant system, SCDHEC\'s Vital Health and Census Data Integration System, automates geocoding and aggregation of vital records data (births and deaths), while a Health Data Query System provides easy access to the aggregated data. By joining aggregate vital records health data with existing socio-economic census data, the system provides a good tool for developing surveillance and intervention strategies while preserving residents\' confidentiality. The point data resulting from the geocoding process (before aggregation) is treated with all the confidentiality of paper certificate data, and stored for future use in very high-resolution studies [<a href="#B84" rid="B84" class=" bibr popnode">84</a>]</p><p id="__p227">In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Output Areas (OAs) have been introduced at the 2001 Census.

Output Areas are built from postcodes, and have been designed for homogeneity and to be static. Each OA contains approximately 125 households.

Software agents are emerging as an important computing paradigm. If an agent were designed to support the analysis of public health data, users would not be required to have access to confidential health records. Rather, they would submit a request to an intelligent analysis agent that would assess the request, and if found appropriate, would complete the analysis and return a result to the data user without exposing any individual-level health data [<a href="#B83" rid="B83" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716439">83</a>].</p><p id="__p229">It is noteworthy that the Health System Resident Component (HSRC), part of RODS, the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance system (described below), is based on similar concepts.

It functions as a case detector in a distributed public health surveillance scheme linking laboratory and radiology data to increase the specificity of case detection.

Richards et al call for sound epidemiological principles and methods to provide the foundation for the data analyses to be displayed on GIS maps. To avoid drawing false conclusions from maps, GIS users need to understand and apply epidemiological principles and methods in formulating study questions, testing hypotheses about cause-and-effect relationships, and critically evaluating how the chosen dataset(s) and GIS method(s), data quality, confounding factors, and bias may influence the interpretation of results, and hence any decisions based on them [<a href="#B7" rid="B7" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716411">7</a>].</p><p id="__p244">According to Monmonier, it is not just easy but also essential to lie with maps. The cartographer\'s paradox is that to avoid hiding critical information in a fog of detail, the map must offer a selective, incomplete view of reality [<a href="#B95" rid="B95" class=" bibr popnode">95</a>]. Public health practitioners need to be alert for "lies" that can range from legitimate and appropriate suppression of some details selectively to help the user focus on what needs to be seen to more serious distortions in which the visual image suggests conclusions that would not be supported by careful epidemiological analysis. For example, when some geographic units of analysis have small denominators, disease rates computed for these areas may appear extremely high if any cases have occurred in these areas (the "small numbers" problem). When the rates for these geographic locations are displayed on a map, readers may incorrectly conclude that these are "hot spots", high priority locations for targeted interventions. More appropriately, these areas should be labelled to indicate that rates are statistically unstable due to small numbers and therefore not shown [<a href="#B7" rid="B7" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716433">7</a>].</p><p id="__p245">Along similar lines, in 1998, Jacquez defined the "gee whiz" effect as "the formulation of hypotheses to explain an apparent (visual) pattern whose existence has not been confirmed", and stressed the importance that appropriate and robust statistical methods be used to support the thematic data layers being displayed and analysed in order to avoid the consequences of visual bias in GIS processes, in which spatial patterns might seem to appear where none actually exists, and inferences might sometimes be made on invalid assumptions [<a href="#B12" rid="B12" class=" bibr popnode">12</a>].</p><p id="__p246">In a personal e-mail communication with Dr. Geoffrey Jacquez five years after his original definition of the "gee whiz" effect, he affirmed that he still stands by the idea that pattern recognition (both spatial and spatio-temporal) requires objective approaches that transcend the subjectivity of the human eye. According to Jacquez, these approaches play a role in both confirmatory and exploratory analyses. He continues: "Especially within the exploratory framework, one must be able to discriminate true patterns from apparent patterns that could be explained by chance. In the absence of such capability, both confirmatory and exploratory analyses spin their wheels because they lack an objective mechanism for identifying and quantifying relationships in the data."

A balanced approach is needed.

One of the most recent NSDI-related US e-government initiatives, Geospatial One-Stop, is intended to revolutionise electronic government by providing a geographic component for use in all Internet-based government activities across all government levels. This will enable immediate discovery and "one-stop" access to spatial metadata and data via a single Internet location/interface for different kinds of analyses and improved decision-making, and will eliminate the redundancies of costs associated with (duplicate efforts of) spatial data collection, conversion between formats, production and dissemination [<a href="#B58" rid="B58" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716322">58</a>,<a href="#B100" rid="B100" class=" bibr popnode">100</a>].</p><p id="__p268">To achieve its vision, the Geospatial One-Stop initiative has launched Geodata.gov <a href="http://www.geodata.gov/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.geodata.gov/</a>, a Web-based portal for one-stop access to maps, data and other spatial services that will simplify the ability of all levels of government, private sector, academia and citizens to find spatial data and learn more about spatial projects underway.</p><p id="__p269" class="p p-last">The US health sector is rapidly becoming a responsive and integral part of the NSDI.

The final link in the surveillance chain is the application of these data to prevention and control.

[<a href="#B108" rid="B108" class=" bibr popnode">108</a>]</p><p id="__p287">The systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of health information are critical aspects of public health. Surveillance is the problem-finding/monitoring process. This should ideally be linked to public health action, which is the problem-solving process. Traditionally, surveillance was used for acute infectious diseases, but over the past decades there has been a significant expansion of surveillance into new areas of public health concern including injuries, environmental health, occupational safety and health, and chronic diseases.</p><p id="__p288">One of the main problems of conventional public health disease surveillance, which relies on physician and laboratory reporting and manual off-line analysis of surveillance data, is that it is ill equipped for the timely detection of bioterrorist attacks [<a href="#B2" rid="B2" class=" bibr popnode">2</a>,<a href="#B55" rid="B55" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716430">55</a>]. It is unlikely that without an event or alert to raise his or her index of suspicion, a physician will attribute the early symptoms and signs of disease in a bioattack victim appropriately and report the case. A key limitation of the current system is that the lone physician is blind to the cases his or her colleagues in a nearby hospital are seeing &#x02013; knowledge that might lead the physician to consider uncommon diseases more strongly in his or her diagnostic reasoning [<a href="#B55" rid="B55" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716437">55</a>].</p><p id="__p289">In fact, without a continuous (in real or near real time) and comprehensive health monitoring system covering a wide geographical scope, the public health community will never have much advanced warning of bioterrorist attacks to be able to abort them at an early stage, and limit their negative effects [<a href="#B2" rid="B2" class=" bibr popnode">2</a>]. The question remains, if we build such systems (some early examples already exist &#x02013; see below), what data should we monitor in real or near real time in order to be able to identify a covert bioterrorist attack.</p><p id="__p290">Syndromic surveillance methods that can detect disease at an earlier stage are increasingly becoming an important research direction for public health surveillance. Because the data used by syndromic surveillance systems cannot be used to establish a specific diagnosis in any particular individual, syndromic surveillance systems must be designed to detect signature patterns of disease in a population to achieve sufficient specificity. For example, it would be irrational to use only the symptom of fever to attempt to establish a working diagnosis of inhalational anthrax in an individual, but it would be very sensible to consider anthrax release in a community if we were to observe a pattern of 1,000 individuals with fever distributed in a linear streak across an urban region consistent with the prevailing wind direction two days earlier [<a href="#B55" rid="B55" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716395">55</a>].</p><p id="__p291">A recent review paper by Mandl et al provides a comprehensive review of syndromic surveillance systems, and is intended to serve as a guide for informaticians, public health managers, and practitioners who are currently planning deployment of such systems in their regions. The paper also includes detailed discussions of the different outbreak detection methods that work with temporal and spatial data, as well as the metrics for measuring surveillance system quality. An interesting point raised by Mandl and his colleagues is the need for truly unique person identifier, so that individuals are not double-counted as they move between healthcare institutions (sometimes during the same day). Mandl et al also suggest using data already collected for other purposes whenever this is possible, since implementing new data collection processes can have prohibitive costs, and healthcare workers have repeatedly demonstrated poor compliance with additional data collection and administrative tasks. They also recommend designing "dual use" systems and not only focusing on the detection of bioterrorism or very rare outbreaks in order to boost the sustainability and long-term funding viability of such systems [<a href="#B109" rid="B109" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_308487342">109</a>].

MAC maintains an extensive array of datasets (more than 150 databases/map layers in CATS alone) to ensure their ability to provide their customers (federal and government agencies) with the information they need in the form of GIS maps, tables, and analyses for planning, preparedness, response, and mitigation in relation to disasters and emergencies. MAC can produce GIS maps from important prediction model outputs, e.g., a hurricane wind model, a toxic plume model or an earthquake model, coupled with real-time data to provide estimates for projected damages in affected regions. It can also generate maps from damage assessment data after a disaster has occurred to visualise actual damages by analysing collected aerial reconnaissance and ground truth data. This can help emergency managers appreciate the spatial extent of damage, learn who was affected by the disaster and which resources were affected, and make timely, informed decision accordingly (e.g., a plume model can help determine those areas requiring evacuation; early informed interventions almost always result in mitigation of disaster effects) [<a href="#B111" rid="B111" class=" bibr popnode">111</a>,<a href="#B112" rid="B112" class=" bibr popnode">112</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec59" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec59title">Real-time/near-real-time GIS for epidemics management</h3><p id="__p296" class="p p-first">Johnson and Johnson provide a good, easy-to-read general introduction to GIS application areas, advantages and methods in public health and healthcare, with some emphasis on GIS uses in epidemiological surveillance and epidemics management [<a href="#B113" rid="B113" class=" bibr popnode">113</a>].</p><p id="__p297">The WHO has developed a comprehensive Event Management System to manage critical information about outbreaks and to ensure accurate and timely communications between key international public health professionals, including WHO Regional Offices, Country Offices, collaborating centres and partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network [<a href="#B114" rid="B114" class=" bibr popnode">114</a>].

Some of the mapping services presented provided very detailed information down to individual street/building level (in Hong Kong).

This proactive, geographically based approach can deal more effectively with and provide early warnings of health threats and disease outbreaks, particularly those caused by bio-weapons [<a href="#B2" rid="B2" class=" bibr popnode">2</a>].</p><p id="__p300">Davenhall distinguishes between a health surveillance system and a disease surveillance system. The former features a lower threshold for action than the latter. By the time someone is admitted to an acute care hospital with a communicable disease, that person may have been symptomatic for days or weeks and may have already been seen by healthcare professionals repeatedly, and would have already spread the disease to large numbers of persons. For example, smallpox, which begins with a rash that becomes more painful and extensive, is often initially treated with an anti-inflammatory antihistamine drug such as Diphenhydramine HCL (Benadryl). When this treatment proves ineffective, laboratory work is ordered and the diagnosis then made. From a community health perspective, a spike in the number of prescriptions for Benadryl in one area could be used as an indicator of a possible smallpox outbreak. A CHSS should be able to automatically detect such spike and raise an alarm early enough to contain the outbreak [<a href="#B2" rid="B2" class=" bibr popnode">2</a>].</p><p id="__p301">CHSS will have a GIS-based incident tracking system. Human intervention should not be required until pre-established critical levels &#x02013; in the number and/or clustering of occurrences &#x02013; are reached. The rule-based CHSS will use data interpretations made by epidemiologists and other public health officials [<a href="#B2" rid="B2" class=" bibr popnode">2</a>].</p><p id="__p302" class="p p-last">However, the transition from episodic investigation to ongoing monitoring using GIS requires more robust data collection and analysis. CHSS relies on a continuous stream of clinical data that are gathered automatically across geographical boundaries. CHSS data include clinical data, such as symptoms, diagnostic results, and procedures (all coded using a suitable terminology or classification) and geographic information such as the locations of patients, medical personnel and assets, and outbreaks. To be reliable for the purposes of a CHSS, population-based data must also describe relatively small geographical areas. Data that reflect the level of "wellness" of a population in a geographic area are necessary to draw inferences about changes in health levels and exposure to disease [<a href="#B2" rid="B2" class=" bibr popnode">2</a>].</p></div><div id="__sec61" class="sec"><h3 id="__sec61title">The Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance system (RODS)</h3><p id="__p303" class="p p-first">RODS is a NEDSS-compliant, GIS-enabled (using ESRI ArcIMS 4.0) public health surveillance system for early detection of disease outbreaks, including those caused by bioterrorism. Hospitals send RODS data from clinical encounters over virtual private networks and leased lines in real time using the HL7 message protocol. RODS automatically classifies the free-text registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories (constitutional, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, botulinic, rash, haemorrhagic, and other) using Bayesian classifiers. It stores the data in a relational database, aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques, applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data, and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts [<a href="#B49" rid="B49" class=" bibr popnode">49</a>,<a href="#B55" rid="B55" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716375">55</a>]. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products in a similar manner, but currently receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. It also groups sales data of OTC products into analytic product categories relevant to public health surveillance (e.g., bronchial remedies, diarrhoea remedies, etc.) [<a href="#B55" rid="B55" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716343">55</a>,<a href="#B56" rid="B56" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716333">56</a>].</p><p id="__p304">Real-time (continuous stream) transfer of data is to be preferred to batch transfer of data, as the latter may delay detection of suspicious events by as long as the time interval (periodicity) between batch transfers. For example, a surveillance system with daily batch transfer may delay by one day the detection of an outbreak [<a href="#B55" rid="B55" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716286">55</a>]. Time intervals as small as hours can make a difference when a large cohort is exposed to rapidly progressing diseases such as anthrax. Furthermore, the challenge of merging similar data arriving from multiple sources with different time latencies is now a focus of attention in new surveillance approaches [<a href="#B56" rid="B56" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716440">56</a>].</p><p id="__p305">Preliminary studies suggest that sales of OTC healthcare products can be used for the early detection of outbreaks. People often engage in self-care with OTC medications such as cough syrups before seeking professional medical care. RODS\' National Retail Data Monitor (NRDM) receives data daily from 10,000 stores/pharmacies that sell healthcare products. These stores belong to national chains that process sales data centrally and utilise Universal Product Bar Codes (UPC codes) and scanners to collect sales information at the cash register. The high degree of retail sales data automation enables NRDM to collect information from thousands of store locations in near real time for use in public health surveillance. Algorithms monitor the data automatically every day to detect unusual sales patterns. The current niche for NRDM is early detection of a mass exposure of a large number of people through air, food, or water contamination (a cohort exposure). Soon after such an exposure, the cohort will become symptomatic, and, depending on the symptoms, may begin self-treatment and then either recover or seek medical care. If the cohort is large enough, sales of OTC healthcare products will increase significantly above the normal, background sales level. The announced longer-term project plans include the expansion of monitoring to the level of selected prescription medications based on another standard coding system that is used in industry data systems [<a href="#B56" rid="B56" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716291">56</a>].</p><p id="__p306">Wagner et al cite the following desiderata for systems like RODS\' NRDM: (1) collection and analysis of data in as near as real time as possible; (2) completeness of sales data collection (&#x0003e;=70% is considered an adequate figure) for both early detection and sensitivity to smaller outbreaks; (3) availability of precise spatial information like individual store locations, or at least store Zip Codes to support adequate spatial analysis of sales data; (4) collection of supplemental data, e.g., about retailers\' promotions or how day of the week affects local sales volumes; (5) a system for maintaining UPC code masters and mappings to analytic categories (as new product codes are assigned); (6) an effective link with the intended users of the system (public health authorities) to effect the desired actions (e.g., order quarantine); and (7) as most large urban population centres cross jurisdictional health boundaries, a centralised national approach is recommended to provide a complete picture of the health of contiguous regions and prevent any redundant data collection for overlapping nearby jurisdictions [<a href="#B56" rid="B56" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716380">56</a>].</p><p id="__p307">Being linked to public health authorities and response also allows system developers to learn from prospective experience, to validate their data sources and algorithms in real-world settings, and to improve systems\' ability to differentiate true infectious disease clusters from false alarms [<a href="#B109" rid="B109" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_308487343">109</a>]. RODS also has a Web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. RODS\' password-protected, encrypted Web site allows users to review healthcare registration and sales of OTC healthcare products on epidemic plots and maps. When a user logs in, RODS will check the user\'s profile and will display data only for his or her health department\'s jurisdiction [<a href="#B55" rid="B55" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716346">55</a>,<a href="#B56" rid="B56" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716344">56</a>]. Because populations and market share coverage for sales of OTC healthcare products differ between Zip Codes, plotting raw sales counts is uninformative. NRDM maps represent a novel approach to presenting surveillance data. They plot for each Zip Code &#x02013; using the colours green, blue, yellow, orange, and red to indicate increasing levels of concern &#x02013; how "unusual" sales were for the day in question relative to historical patterns of sales for that Zip Code. In particular, the colours represent the number of standard deviations by which the observed sales of a product category in a Zip Code deviate from the expected counts. In presenting the data in this fashion, the map serves as a device to focus the user\'s attention on the degree(s) of anomaly. A user can quickly spot whether the map is predominantly green with a scattering of blue Zip Codes as would be expected, or whether there are confluent or linear patterns of blue, yellow, orange, or red indicating "unusual" sales activities. The map monitor computes the number of standard deviations relative to a residual signal that has zero mean and constant variation after removal of weekly and longer trends in the data by wavelet transformation. This procedure is intended to produce a "normalised" map that is very sensitive to sudden increases in product counts as would be the case in a medium- to large-scale air, food, or water contamination. Alternative data transformations are possible using different signal processing approaches focused on detecting more gradual increases. RODS researchers plan in the near future to screen the maps automatically with spatial scan statistics to identify those with anomalies suggesting a need for human review [<a href="#B56" rid="B56" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716396">56</a>].</p><p id="__p308" class="p p-last">Some of RODS software has been bundled into downloadable ready-to-use packages that are available from <a href="http://www.health.pitt.edu/rods/sw/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.health.pitt.edu/rods/sw/</a>.

Its purpose will be to collect, hold and, as appropriate, analyse and interpret temporally and spatially tagged environmental and related health data throughout Scotland (e.g., attempt to correlate environmental exposures and health outcomes). EHS3 will also disseminate this data, much of which is currently available but is under-utilised [<a href="#B57" rid="B57" class=" bibr popnode">57</a>,<a href="#B116" rid="B116" class=" bibr popnode">116</a>].</p><p id="__p311">EHS3 developers need to determine what information is currently available to begin with, and also need to address the problems of incomplete health and environmental data.

From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events.</p><p id="__p314">However, although multiple novel spatial statistical and GIS methods are potentially available, we still need to unambiguously determine which method(s) specifically should be used by practitioners for each specific health condition of interest, and whether the proposed methods are cost-effective and scalable. A critical review is needed of the evidence for GIS for specific preventable, mitigable and treatable health conditions. A good starting point may be the CDC "Guide to Community Preventive Services" <a href="http://www.thecommunityguide.org/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.thecommunityguide.org/</a>. Topics identified in this guide (e.g., alcohol abuse, cancer, diabetes, mental health, motor vehicle occupant injury, oral health, physical activity, sexual behaviour, social environment, tobacco product use, vaccine preventable diseases, violence) could be addressed one by one by conducting a focused review of GIS literature on each topic, and then categorising the "nature of the scientific evidence" documenting whether GIS add any value to our understanding and management of the reviewed topic and/or the evidence that it would be feasible and cost-effective for the respective public health programmes tackling the reviewed topic to adopt GIS. This could inform the development of successful GIS business plans for the health conditions under consideration. A good example that comes to mind in this context is the 73-page "GIS for cancer" handbook titled "Using Geographic Information Systems Technology in the Collection, Analysis, and Presentation of Cancer Registry Data: A Handbook of Basic Practices" that was published by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries [<a href="#B118" rid="B118" class=" bibr popnode">118</a>]. (However, as is the case with any country-specific GIS research and publications, care should be exercised when extending findings and recommendations to other countries with different health and healthcare system settings.)</p><p id="__p315">In reviewing GIS literature for the above mentioned purposes, this author appreciates the fact that the set of definitions and criteria for reviewing evidence as used in the CDC Community Guide is not directly usable for reviewing currently available GIS literature due to the nature of the latter; a modified set of definitions and criteria first needs to be developed. Also organising focus groups that bring together programme administrators, practitioners and the public is required to complement the expected gaps and deficiencies in current GIS literature, and to define the key questions that decision makers would want to be able to answer with GIS for any health condition under review, and think explicitly about what data and methods should be used to answer those questions.</p><p id="__p316">Traditionally, two broad types of GIS applications can be distinguished which also reflect the two traditions in health geography (geography of disease and geography of healthcare systems), namely health outcomes and epidemiology applications and healthcare delivery applications. The use of GIS for improving hospital bed availability is among the most notable applications under the latter category. There are also studies at the interface (overlap) between epidemiological and healthcare delivery applications, for example in relation to healthcare commissioning and needs assessment.</p><p id="__p317">However, despite all these potentials for GIS, they remain very much under-utilised in the UK NHS in mostly low-level, non-strategic tasks and in a largely fragmented and uncoordinated way. Spatial data and GIS are still not mentioned in any main UK health information strategy or policy document (the US seems to be somewhat ahead of the UK in this respect).

Researchers have come to the conclusion that more networking is needed of people, skills, expertise and data. This can be achieved by establishing networks of GIS users from both the NHS and local authorities at local and higher levels to encourage more joined-up working, share expertise and experiences, as well as establish contacts and trust, and raise the awareness of the types of data that are held by different organisations. A dedicated Web site acting as forum or virtual network on the Web is one way to realise these networks of GIS users.

For each health condition amenable to GIS processing within the NHS, the desired information output and ways of using it must be also determined. Tomlison\'s methodology is targeted at people who have been charged with launching or implementing GIS for their organisation, and is thus strongly recommended in this regard [<a href="#B119" rid="B119" class=" bibr popnode">119</a>]. Perhaps the NHS should also take a closer look at the three sets of standards published by the US CDC National Public Health Performance Standards Programme (NPHPSP), and their associated assessment instruments [<a href="#B120" rid="B120" class=" bibr popnode">120</a>] and implementation toolkit [<a href="#B121" rid="B121" class=" bibr popnode">121</a>], as well as NPHPSP\'s Essential Public Health Services fundamental framework for NPHPSP instruments [<a href="#B122" rid="B122" class=" bibr popnode">122</a>]. Another project worth learning from in this context is the US Primary Care Service Area Project (PCSA &#x02013; <a href="http://pcsa.hrsa.gov/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://pcsa.hrsa.gov/</a>). The PCSA Project builds on the Hospital Service Area approach that has been successfully employed by Dr. John Wennberg and his Dartmouth colleagues to produce the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care series <a href="http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=343292&amp;issue-id=10204&amp;journal-id=122&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/</a>. The PCSA database contains nationwide data of interest to US health policymakers at all jurisdictional levels as well as researchers about US primary healthcare resources, populations, utilisation, and associated outcomes compiled and presented in newly developed units of analysis, the Primary Care Service Areas (PCSAs), and related to other geopolitical regions [<a href="#B123" rid="B123" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" id="__tag_136716313">123</a>].</p><p id="__p320">Our experience with the health and healthcare applications of GIS has markedly increased over the last decade. However, GIS have been usually applied to time-limited, single, isolated aetiological research or surveillance issues processing mainly retrospective data rather than to ongoing, broad efforts and wide-scale applications processing real-time or near-real-time data for health planning, promotion and protection.</p><p id="__p321">Moreover, in the early 1990s much attention was focused on GIS as a basis for spatial information systems. But soon it became clear that the pure technical approach had to be replaced by a more holistic approach comprising organisational, political and technical matters at the different local, national, regional, and global levels. The concept of "Spatial Data Infrastructure" (SDI) became a reality.</p><p id="__p322">SDI principles originated in two US National Research Council reports in the early 1990s [<a href="#B124" rid="B124" class=" bibr popnode">124</a>,<a href="#B125" rid="B125" class=" bibr popnode">125</a>]. SDIs first developed outside the health sector, and then belatedly health began to discover their importance in many applications. SDIs contain the people and institutions that make, maintain, and make accessible, the foundation data layers that permit the custodians of other data layers to attach their data to the foundation layers. It must be stressed that the contents of a national health spatial data infrastructure are not just any georeferenced health data but, in addition, the foundation spatial data to which health data can be attached. The foundation layers for a health spatial data and information infrastructure are best exemplified in the US by PCSAs and Hospital Service Area data layers provided by the Dartmouth Project (see above). In a personal e-mail communication with Professor Gerard Rushton, he argues PCSAs and Hospital Service Area data layers are spatial data foundation layers because other US health data often collected and maintained locally, are more valuable after they have been linked to these layers (Gerard Rushton, Department of Geography, University of Iowa, personal communication &#x02013; December 2003).</p><p id="__p323">In a workshop paper presented in 2001, Professor David Rhind counts about 40 countries developing their national SDIs and highlights the problems that have been faced and the lessons learned. The latter include ensuring the involvement of the private sector as a central SDI player from the outset, having a realistic vision, securing political leadership and support, and coordinating between the many SDI players [<a href="#B126" rid="B126" class=" bibr popnode">126</a>].</p><p id="__p324">Table <a href="/pmc/articles/PMC343292/table/T2/" target="table" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="T2" rid-ob="ob-T2" co-legend-rid=""><span style="position: relative;text-decoration:none;">&#x200B;<span class="figpopup-sensitive-area" style="left: -2.5em;">Table2</span></span><span>2</span></a> presents a summary of the recipes and main recommendations provided by various specialist groups and researchers from around the world for a successful implementation of a national/regional/global spatial data and information infrastructure that can also support real-time GIS public health applications.</p><!--table ft1--><!--table-wrap mode="anchored" t5--><div class="table-wrap table anchored whole_rhythm" id="T2"><h3>Table 2</h3><!--caption a7--><div class="caption"><p id="__p325">Requirements for a successful implementation of a national/regional/global geo-information infrastructure.

A good example of such gems that should be exposed and disseminated are Boscoe and Pickle\'s recently published guidelines for choosing geographic units for choropleth rate maps in the context of public health applications [<a href="#B127" rid="B127" class=" bibr popnode">127</a>]. The best, current evidence derived from GIS research should be always embedded (and regularly updated) in all training programmes. This is one important way of linking the academia and research communities to real-world practice.</p><p id="__p330">Sufficient financial resources must be available to invest in training people and retaining technical expertise.

Today, solutions exist that can preserve data confidentiality while still enabling fine-level analyses and reliable results. These solutions involve: (1) the use of statistical and epidemiological methods to mask the geographic location of data in a way that can still permit meaningful analysis, e.g., special types of spatial and temporal aggregation of data; (2) the development and use of software agents and health system resident components that can process an analysis request and return a result to the data user without exposing any individual-level health data; (3) the creation of secure networked environments with limited and multiple levels of access (to confidential data) in which public health researchers can be carefully monitored to ensure protection of individual and household confidentiality; and (4) the development, publication and strict enforcement of appropriate, unambiguous policies and regulations.</p><p id="__p333">Best standards, specifications, rules, designs, and practices (covering spatial metadata, geocoding, accessibility for visually and manually impaired data users, and data access restrictions among other things) must be created/agreed upon and published for uniform Internet-enabled GIS services.</p><p id="__p334">All relevant infrastructure and systems stakeholders should be involved in the development of appropriate data models (or ontologies) for their various applications to facilitate data selection and integration, and ensure a common understanding of data. This author also predicts even more exciting developments in the coming months and years with the rapid advances in geospatial Semantic Web research and technologies [<a href="#B128" rid="B128" class=" bibr popnode">128</a>,<a href="#B129" rid="B129" class=" bibr popnode">129</a>].</p><p id="__p335">Data/analysis problems and errors are not uncommon and include scale issues, the "small numbers" problem, issues of the atomistic and ecologic fallacies, changing activity spaces of mapped subjects, and the frequent variations between different locations in data collection methods and standards, in the recorded items, particularly data on patient residence, and in diagnostic standards and case definitions. Users must develop increased sensitivity to and awareness of the various types of data errors and uncertainty, as well as competency in techniques for recognising and reducing their negative impact on conclusions drawn from spatial analysis. There is also a need for intelligent tools specifically designed for public health, and seamlessly weaved into everyday public health workflows and decision-making processes to enable users to focus and spend the larger part of their work time on what they want to achieve rather than on learning and overcoming the limitations of tools they are supposed to use to achieve their goals. The tools must be able to convey meaningful, bottom-line conclusions that can support the decision maker rather than just outputting bunches of facts. The ideal tools also need to be fault-tolerant and capable of analysing and presenting assembled data in ways that facilitate only appropriate interpretations of integrated data. This can be achieved by using some form of user friendly, "intelligent", goal-oriented health GIS wizards (based on robust statistical and epidemiological methods where appropriate), so that only valid results and maps are produced, even when users attempt to select inappropriate settings for a particular analysis.</p><p id="__p336">The tools are also best designed and built to work in modular and nested fashions, so that they may be reused, linked and combined in different ways as needed to serve different scenarios and compound situations with little or no modifications (of the tools).</p><p id="__p337">Along similar lines, Professor Stan Openshaw thinks that GIS need to adopt and link to technologies that go beyond data collection, management and ownership, standards, simple mapping, and trivial analysis. According to Openshaw, the ideal spatial analysis methods should be safe and user friendly for use by people with no higher degrees in statistical or spatial sciences. The methods should also respond to user needs on the ground, be highly automated, explicitly handle spatial data imprecision, and produce self-evident results that can be mapped and communicated to non-experts. Openshaw\'s proposed typology of methods includes among others "pattern spotters and testers" and "relationship seekers and provers" [<a href="#B130" rid="B130" class=" bibr popnode">130</a>].</p><p id="__p338">Community data sharing must be systematic and regular. Data-sharing agreements are needed that address confidentiality and other concerns, allow redistribution of data to any public health authority, and permit data to be used in research. Data have to be collected uniformly and include specifications for update frequency and allowed dissemination in different emergency and non-emergency situations, and for purposes other than those for which they were originally collected. It is recommended that a combined top-down and bottom-up incremental (phased) implementation approach be adopted. Longer-term solutions usually require a series of small successes, carefully built upon in incremental fashion over time. In fact, much of the wider vision of a national/regional/global public health spatial data and information infrastructure can be gradually and incrementally achieved through disparately funded and managed short-term projects, as long as we can ensure that these short-term projects make a useful and lasting contribution towards this wider vision. Short-term bottom-up projects can feed valuable experience into the formulation and revision of the relevant policies and strategies. Moreover, by creating "proof of concept and benefits applications", these projects can be also used to gain and continue political support for the wider vision, and secure further funding towards achieving it.</p><p id="__p339">We also quickly reviewed existing SDIs and SDI initiatives at different levels of development worldwide, including the US National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and the related Geospatial One-Stop initiative with its Web-based service, Geodata.gov; the UK GIgateway; INSPIRE, the INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe, which intends to trigger the creation of a European Spatial Data Infrastructure (ESDI); other national SDIs; and the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI) activities.</p><p id="__p340">Finally, we discussed public health surveillance and syndromic surveillance methods (especially in the context of bioterrorism). We reviewed the use of real-time/near-real-time GIS for emergency and epidemics management, with examples from the 2003 SARS outbreak, and somewhat detailed reviews of the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance system (RODS) from the US and two large-scale environmental surveillance projects from the UK. Such applications currently involve limited SDI-like arrangements, and would certainly benefit from the development of mature SDIs in their respective regions.</p><p id="__p341">The dream remains to develop a universal multivariate surveillance system that can collect, analyse and interpret health-related information worldwide using modern information infrastructures for the global prevention of a wide range of health problems, or at least the early detection of such problems in order to mitigate their effects. GIS technologies and services that can function proactively in real time are extremely and critically important to realise this global public health surveillance vision (and indeed any smaller-scale surveillance services). Such surveillance services also require a sound and comprehensive spatial health data and information infrastructure to be built and maintained in a coherent way at all operation levels.</p><p id="__p342" class="p p-last">As the reader might have noticed, there are many requirements, e.g., standards and security, and ingredients of success in common to both the nation-wide implementation of integrated electronic health and social care records and the building of a national spatial health information infrastructure. Both development directions are closely interrelated. In fact, properly implemented electronic health and social care records are always required (in aggregated form) as a key data source within a national spatial health information infrastructure.</p></div><div id="idm140527928808672" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="idm140527928808672title">References</h2><div class="ref-list-sec sec" id="reference-list"><ul class="back-ref-list" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li id="B1"><span class="citation">Gore A.
